<p>If these simple tales serve to deepen in the

that the college girl is very much like

<h2><i>THE EMOTIONS OF A SUB-GUARD</i></h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>

<p class="stories">I<br />

THE EMOTIONS OF A SUB-GUARD</p>

<p>Theodora pushed through the
yellow and purple crowd, a sea of
flags and ribbons and great paper
flowers, caught a glimpse of the red
and green river that flowed steadily in at the
other door, and felt her heart contract. What
a lot of girls! And the freshmen were always
beaten&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but I <i>can't</i> move! You'll have
to wait," said some one. Theodora realized that
she was crowding, and apologized. A tall girl
with a purple stick moved by the great line
that stretched from the gymnasium to the
middle of the campus, and looked keenly at
Theodora. "How did you get here?" she
asked. "You must go to the end&mdash;we're not
letting any one slip in at the front. The jam
is bad enough as it is."</p>

<p>Theodora blushed. "I'm&mdash;I'm on the Sub-team,"
she murmured, "and I'm late. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the junior. "Why did you
come in here? You go in the other door. Just
pass right in here, though," and Theodora,
quite crimson with the consciousness of a hundred
eyes, pulled her mackintosh about her
and slipped in ahead of them all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Oh, <i>here's</i> to Ninety-<i>yellow</i>,</p>
<p class="i4">And her <i>praise</i> we'll ever <i>tell</i>&mdash;<i>oh</i>,</p>
<p>Drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the line called after her, and her mouth trembled
with excitement. She could just hear the
other line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> to Ninety-<i>green</i>,</p>
<p>She's the <i>finest</i> ever <i>seen</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and then the door slammed and she was upstairs
on the big empty floor. A member of the
decorating committee nodded at her from the
gallery. "Pretty, isn't it?" she called down.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" said Theodora, earnestly.
One half of the gallery&mdash;her half&mdash;was all
trimmed with yellow and purple. Great yellow
chrysanthemums flowered on every pillar,
and enormous purple shields with yellow numerals
lined the wall. Crossed banners and
flags filled in the intervals, and from the middle
beam depended a great purple butterfly
with yellow wings, flapping defiance at a red
and green insect of indistinguishable species
that decorated the other side. A bevy of ushers
in white duck, with <i>boutonnières</i> of English
violets or single American beauties, took their
places and began to pin on crêpe paper sunbonnets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
of yellow or green, chattering and
watching the clock. A tall senior, with a red
silk waist and a green scarf across her breast,
was arranging a box near the centre of the
sophomore side and practising maintaining
her balance on it while she waved a red baton.
She was the leader of the Glee Club, and she
would lead the sophomore songs. Theodora
heard a confused scuffle on the stairs, and in a
few seconds the galleries were crowded with
the rivers of color that poured from the entrance
doors. It seemed that they were full
now, but she knew that twice as many more
would crowd in. She walked quickly to the
room at the end of the hall and opened the
door. Beneath and all around her was the hum
and rumble of countless feet and voices, but in
the room all was still. The Subs lounged in the
window-seats and tried to act as if it wasn't
likely to be any affair of theirs: one little yellow-haired
girl confided flippantly to her
neighbor that she'd "only accepted the position
so as to be able to sit on the platform
and be sure of a good place." The Team were
sitting on the floor staring at their captain,
who was talking earnestly in a low voice&mdash;giving
directions apparently. The juniors who
coached them opened the door and grinned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
cheerfully. They attached great purple streamers
to their shirt-waists, and addressed themselves
to the freshmen generally.</p>

<p>"Your songs are great! That 'Alabama
Coon' one was awfully good! You make twice
the noise that they do!"</p>

<p>The Team brightened up. "I think they're
pretty good," the captain said, with an attempt
at a conversational tone. "Er&mdash;when
do we begin?"</p>

<p>"The Subs can go out now," said one of
the coaches, opening the door importantly.
"Now, girls, remember not to wear yourselves
out with kicking and screaming. You're right
under the President, and he'll have a fit if you
kick against the platform. Miss Kassan says
that this <i>must</i> be a quiet game! She <i>will not</i>
have that howling! It's her particular request,
she says. Now, go on. And if anything happens
to Grace, Julia Wilson takes her place, <i>and
look out for Alison Greer</i>&mdash;she pounds awfully.
Keep as still as you can!"</p>

<p>They trotted out and ranged themselves on
the platform, and when Theodora got to the
point of lifting her eyes from the floor to gaze
down at the sophomore Subs across the hall
in front of another audience, the freshmen
were off in another song. To her excited eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
there were thousands of them, brilliant in purple
and yellow, and shouting to be heard of
her parents in Pennsylvania. A junior in yellow
led them with a great purple stick, and
they chanted, to a splendid march tune that
made even the members of the Faculty keep
time on the platform, their hymn to victory.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hurrah!</i> <i>hurrah!</i> the <i>yellow</i> is on <i>top</i>!</p>
<p><i>Hurrah!</i> <i>hurrah!</i> the <i>purple</i> cannot <i>drop</i>!</p>
<p><i>We</i> are Ninety-<i>yellow</i> and our <i>fame</i> shall never <i>stop</i>,</p>
<p><i>'Rah</i>, <i>'rah</i>, <i>'rah</i>, for the <i>freshmen</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They sang so well and so loud and strong,
shouting out the words so plainly and keeping
such splendid time, that as the verse and
chorus died away audience and sophomores
alike clapped them vigorously, much to their
delight and pride. Theodora looked up for
the first time and saw as in a dream individual
faces and clothes. They were packed in
the running-gallery till the smallest of babies
would have been sorely tried to find a crevice
to rest in. A fringe of skirts and boots hung
from the edge, where the wearers sat pressed
against the bars with their feet hanging over.
They blotted out the windows and sat out on
the great beams, dangling their banners into
space. She could not see the Faculty behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
her, but she knew they were adorned with
rosettes, and that the favored ones carried
flowers&mdash;the air where she sat was sweet with
violets. A group of ushers escorted a small
and nervous lady to the platform: on the way
she threw back her cape and the sophomores
caught sight of the green bow at her throat.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Oh, <i>here's</i> to Susan <i>Beane</i>,</p>
<p class="i4">She is <i>wearing</i> of the <i>green</i>,</p>
<p>Drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>they sang cheerfully.</p>

<p>Just behind her a tall, commanding woman
stalked somewhat consciously, decked with
yellow streamers and daffodils. The junior
leader consulted a list in her hand, frantically
whispered some words to the allies around
her box, and the freshmen started up their
tribute.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Oh, <i>here's</i> to Kath'rine <i>Storrs</i>,</p>
<p class="i4">Aught but <i>yellow</i> she <i>abhors</i>,</p>
<p>Drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Miss Storrs endeavored to convey with her
glance, dignity, amusement, toleration of
harmless sport, and a repudiation of the personality
involved in the song; but it is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
doubted if even she was satisfied with the result.
Theodora wished she had seen the President
come in. She had been told how he
walked solemnly across the hall, mounted the
platform, unbuttoned his overcoat, and displayed
two gorgeous rosettes of the conflicting
colors&mdash;his official and exclusive privilege.
And she had heard from the Team's retreat
the thunder of applause that greeted this traditional
rite. She wondered whether he cared
who won: whether he realized what it was to
play against a team that had beaten in its
freshman year.</p>

<p>A burst of applause and laughter interrupted
her meditations. She felt herself blushing&mdash;was
it the Team? No: the sophomore
Subs were escorting to the middle of the floor
a child of five or six dressed in brightest emerald
green: a child with a mane of the most
remarkable brick-red hair in the world. She
wore it in the fashion of Alice in Wonderland,
and it grew redder and redder the longer one
looked at it. She held a red ribbon of precisely
the same shade in her hand, and at the
middle of the floor the sophomores suddenly
burst away from her and ran quickly to their
seats, revealing at the end of the ribbon an
enormous and lifelike green frog. The child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
stood for a moment twisting her little green
legs undecidedly, and then, overcome with
embarrassment at the appreciation she had
evoked, shook her flaming locks over her
face, and dragging the frog with her, sometimes
on its side, sometimes on its head, fled
to the sophomores, who bore her off in triumph.</p>

<p>"They got her in Williamsburgh," said
somebody; "they've been hunting for weeks
for a red-haired child, and that frog was from
the drug store&mdash;oh, my dear, how <i>perfectly</i>
darling!"</p>

<p>Alone and unabashed the freshman mascot
took the floor. He was perhaps four years
old and the color of a cake of chocolate. His
costume was canary yellow&mdash;a perfect little
jockey suit, with a purple band on his arm
adorned with Ninety-yellow's class numerals.
He dragged by a twisted cord of purple and
yellow a most startling plum-colored terrier,
of a shade that never was on land or sea, with
a tendency to trip his master up at every step.
In the exact middle of the floor the mascot
paused, rolled his eyes till they seemed in
danger of leaving their sockets, and then at a
shrill whistle from the balcony pulled his yellow
cap from his woolly head and made a deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and courtly bow to his patrons. But the storm
of applause was more than he had been prepared
for, and with a wild look about the hall
and a frantic tug at the cord he dragged the
purple and protesting animal to a corner of
the room, where a grinning elder sister was
stationed for his comfort.</p>

<p>Theodora's heart beat high: theirs was the
best! Everybody was laughing and exclaiming
and questioning; the very sophomores
were shrieking at the efforts of the terrier to
drag the little darkey out again; one member
of the Faculty had laughed himself into something
very like hysteria and giggled weakly
at every twitch of the idiotic purple legs.</p>

<p>"It was Diamond Dyes," Theodora heard
a freshman just above call out excitedly, "and
Esther Armstrong thought of it. They dyed
him every day for a week&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mascot and the dog had trotted up
again, and as they ran back and the animal
gave a more than ordinarily vicious dart, the
poor little boy, yielding suddenly, sat down
with exquisite precision on his companion,
and with distended eyes wailed aloud for his
relative, who disentangled him with difficulty
and bore him away, his cap over his ear and his
little chocolate hands clutching her neck. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the comparative silence that followed the gale
of laughter some bustle and conference was
noticed on the sophomore side, and suddenly
the leader rose, lifting her green and red stick,
and the front line of sophomores and seniors
intoned with great distinctness this thrilling
doggerel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I never saw a purple pup:</p>
<p class="i1">I never hoped to see one:</p>
<p>But now my mind is quite made up&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">I'd rather see than be one!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was received favorably, and the gallery
congratulated the <i>improvisatrice</i>, while
Theodora wondered if that detracted at all
from the glory of the freshmen! The chattering
began again, and she drummed nervously
with her heels against the platform,
while the Centre, sitting next her, prophesied
gloomily that Grace Farwell felt awfully blue,
and that Miss Kassan had said they were
really almost too slight as a team&mdash;the sophomores
were so tall and big. Harriet Foster
had said that she was perfectly certain she 'd
sprain her ankle&mdash;then who would guard
Martha Sutton? It was all very well for Caroline
Wilde to say not to worry about that&mdash;<i>she</i>
hadn't been able to guard her last year!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
She was just like a machine. Her arm went
up and the ball went in; that was all there
was to it. And Kate was as bad. They might
just as well make up their minds&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" cried Theodora, her eyes full
of nervous tears; "if you can't talk any other
way, just keep still!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Centre, huffily, and
then the chattering died away as Miss Kassan
made mysterious marks on the floor, and the
coaches took their places with halves of lemon
and glasses of water in their hands. A door
opened, and in a dead hush the sophomore
team trotted in, two and two, the Suttons
leading, bouncing the big ball before them.
There was such a silence that the thudding
feet seemed to echo and ring through the hall,
and only when Martha suddenly tossed it behind
her at nothing and Kate from some corner
walked over and caught it did the red and
green burst forth in a long-drawn single shout:
"Ninety-gre-e-e-e-e-n!"</p>

<p>Miss Kassan looked apprehensive, but no
<i>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!</i> followed; only,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Here's to <i>Sutton M.</i> and <i>K.</i></p>
<p class="i4">And they'll <i>surely</i> win the <i>day</i>,</p>
<p>Drink 'em <i>down</i>, drink 'em <i>down</i>, drink 'em <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>Theodora set her teeth. "Humph! Will
they?" she muttered savagely.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" cried the Centre, and
they ran in, the big yellow numerals gleaming
effectively against their dark suits, their
braids bobbing behind them. Grace Farwell
was quite pale, with one little spot of red in
each cheek, but Harriet Foster was crimson
with excitement, and the thick braids of auburn
hair that fell over her breast bumped
up and down as she breathed. The thunder
of recognition died away, and they tossed the
ball about nervously, with an eye on Miss
Kassan, who handed a ball to her assistant
and took her place on the line to watch fouls.</p>

<p>"All ready!" said the assistant. There was
a shuffling about, a confusion in the centre, a
concentration of eyes. Harriet Foster took
her place by Martha Sutton and sucked in her
under lip; Grace lined up with Kate in the
centre, clasping and unclasping her hands.
Near her stood a tall slim girl with green numerals
on her sleeve. Her soft dark hair was
coiled lightly into a Greek knot&mdash;it seemed
that the slightest hasty movement must shake
it over her sloping shoulders. It grew into a
clean-cut widow's peak low on her smooth
white forehead; below straight, fine brows two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
great, sad, gray eyes, wide apart, wondered at
life; her oval face was absolutely colorless and
threw out the little scarlet mouth that drooped
softly at the corners. Her hands lightly folded
before her, she swayed a little and looked
dreamily over the heads of the others; she
seemed as incongruous as a Madonna at a
bull-fight.</p>

<p>"Who is that lovely girl in the middle?"
said some one behind Theodora.</p>

<p>"That is a Miss Greer," was the reply.
"She is one of the best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Play!" called the assistant, and the big
ball flew out of her hands into Kate Sutton's.
Kate gave an indescribable twist of her shoulder,
the ball rose in the air, passed over an
utterly irrelevant scuffle in the centre, and
landed in Martha's hands. Martha balanced it
a moment and threw it into the exact middle
of the basket, while the sophomores howled
and pounded and the freshmen looked blankly
at one another. They had not been accustomed
to such simple and efficacious methods.</p>

<p>"One to nothing!" said the assistant,
quietly. "Play!"</p>

<p>Theodora caught her breath. She dared not
look at Grace, but she stared hard at Harriet.
What was Harriet thinking? Not that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
could have done anything&mdash;Martha was two
inches taller and had the ball tight in her hands
two seconds after the assistant had tossed it&mdash;Ah,
what was that?</p>

<p>The ball had reached the floor and Grace
had somehow gotten it. She threw it to Virginia
Wheeler, whose hands were just grazing
it when something shot like a flash of lightning
upon her. She fell back and some one
slapped the ball from between her very finger-nails
up, up into the air, where Kate caught
it, and a few short, sharp, instantaneous passes
got it into Martha's relentless hands. When
it dropped into the basket Alison Greer was
looking beyond the tumult, across the gallery,
into the sky&mdash;white and unruffled. Theodora
winked and tried to think that some one else
had swooped down from her place six seconds
before.</p>

<p>The sophomores were shouting yet. Some
one said: "That's as pretty a piece of team
work as you'll often see, isn't it? Those twins
have eyes in the backs of their heads."</p>

<p>"Two to nothing&mdash;play!" said the assistant.</p>

<p>Theodora did not see the next goal won.
Through a mist she stared into the gallery.
Her eye caught a face she knew, and she wondered
angrily how Miss Carew could smile so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
nonchalantly&mdash;it was her own class! From the
plume in her exquisite toque to the tip of her
patent leather toe she looked the visiting lady
of leisure. The little lace handkerchief dangling
from her hand had a green silk monogram
in the corner&mdash;how dared she wear green? She
nodded at a senior, across the game, and fanned
herself. The freshmen broke into a roar of delight
that ended in a long-drawn <i>A-a-a-a-h!</i>
There was a scuffle, a little cry, a flash from
Alison Greer's corner, and the assistant's
"Three to nothing&mdash;play!" was drowned in
the sophomore shouts.</p>

<p>"You see the freshmen have no chance,
really," said some one behind, calmly, and as
if it made little matter at best. "They are terribly
scared, of course, and they've never had
the training of a big game. The sophomores
have been all through this before&mdash;they don't
mind the crowd. And then, they beat last year,
and that gives them a tremendous confidence.
They're so much bigger, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>Theodora turned and stared at her. She was
very pretty; she had a bunch of violets as big
as her head pinned to her dress, and her hands
were full of daffodils. That was like the Faculty!
To take their flowers and talk that way!
"Horrid thing! <i>Horrid</i> thing!" she muttered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and the Centre, looking angrily at Miss Greer,
assented.</p>

<p>"She's a perfect tiger! Look at her eyes!
She knocked Virginia right over&mdash;you
couldn't stop her with a steam-engine&mdash;Oh!
Oh! <i>Oh!</i> <i>Ninety-yellow!</i> <i>Rah, rah-a-a-a-ah!</i>"</p>

<p>Right out of their hands it had slipped, and
the two girls slid across the floor, fell, reached
out, missed it, and gritted their teeth as the Centres,
with a long-practised man&oelig;uvre, passed
it rapidly from hand to hand to Martha, whose
long arm slid it imperturbably into the basket.</p>

<p>"That Guard doesn't accomplish much,"
said somebody.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, how can she? Look at the
girl! She lays it in like&mdash;like that," was the
answer, as the assistant called, "Five to nothing&mdash;play!"</p>

<p>Theodora looked up at the purple and yellow
gallery. The freshmen stared as if hypnotized
at their steady misfortune, their faces
flushed, their mouths tremulous: when the
players ran to suck the half-lemon or kneeled
to tighten their shoes, their class-mates held
breath till they returned; when Grace got the
ball or Virginia pushed it aside, they started a
cheer that faded into a sigh as Alison Greer
drove everything before her or Kate sent that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
terrible Sutton throw to her sister. Theodora
suddenly started. Just before the ball left Kate,
she threw up her left hand with the palm slightly
spread, and some instinct moved Theodora to
glance at Martha. Her left hand went up instantly
as if to throw back a braid, but it
waved toward the right, and while Harriet
braced herself for a jump the ball flew into
the air far off to the right and the instinctive
motion toward Martha left the way clear for
one of Alison Greer's rushes and sudden, birdlike
throws. In a moment Martha had it, and
as Harriet bent forward to guard, and the ball
toppled unsteadily on the edge of the basket
and fell off, in the midst of the hubbub and
scuffle some one pushed heavily on Harriet,
four hands grasped the ball firmly, somebody
called, "Foul, foul!" and as five panting girls
hurled themselves against the wall and the assistant
tossed up where it fell, to make sure
of fair play, Harriet dropped with her foot beneath
her and did not get up. Martha put the
ball in from an amazing distance, and in the
storm of applause no one noticed the freshman
Guard, till the cry of, "Six to nothing&mdash;play!"
found her still sitting there.</p>

<p>The ball was dropped, and they ran up to
her. Two doctors hurried out; she half rose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
fell back and bit her lip. The freshmen
craned out over the gallery, the sophomores
shook their heads; "Too bad, too bad!" they
murmured. Two freshmen made a chair, lifted
Harriet quickly and ran out with her, the doctors
followed, and in the dead hush they heard
her voice as the door closed.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, girls&mdash;go right on&mdash;don't
wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plucky girl," said a man's voice. "It's a
shame!"</p>

<p>The freshmen looked very blue; the team
stood about in groups; the sophomores waited
politely at one side. Martha went over to
Grace and held her hand out: "I'm terribly
sorry," she said earnestly, "it's too bad. They
say your Subs are very good, though."</p>

<p>Grace nodded, and ran over to the coaches,
who walked aside with her for a moment, talking
earnestly. Presently they came over to the
platform and the Centre nudged Theodora
enviously. "Go on!" she whispered. "Grace
wants you!"</p>

<p>Theodora gasped. "Not me&mdash;not me!"
she objected feebly. "Me&mdash;guard&mdash;Martha
Sutton!"</p>

<p>"Go on!" said somebody, and they pushed
her out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, Theodora&mdash;hurry up, now!"</p>

<p>The people seemed to swim before her; for
one dreadful moment she longed for her home
as she had never longed before. Her knees
shook and the clapping of the class sounded
faraway. With her eyes on the floor she moved
out; halfway to the centre Virginia Wheeler
stepped to meet her and put her arm over
Theodora's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't be scared, Theo," she said, "don't
be scared, but help us out&mdash;heaven knows
we need it!"</p>

<p>"Watch Martha&mdash;don't take your eyes off
her!" whispered the coach as she handed the
lemon to the new Guard.</p>

<p>As in a dream Theodora passed to the
lower basket. Martha patted her on the shoulder.
"Hello!" she said in a bluff, friendly way,
and then the assistant called, "Six to nothing,
play!" and threw the ball. It dropped in the
middle, and there was a terrible scrimmage for
at least four minutes, while the people swayed
and sighed and clapped and screamed, for the
freshmen were getting terribly excited and
rapidly losing their self-control, as it became
evident that their team was struggling desperately
and making one of the longest fights
on record for the ball they were determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to have. It was almost in the basket, it tottered
on the edge, it fell, and Kate Sutton
caught it&mdash;how, no one knew, for it was nowhere
near her. The freshmen were shrieking
with rage, the sophomores clapping with
triumph. Every eye in the hall was fixed on
Kate Sutton&mdash;every eye but Theodora's.</p>

<p>She watched Martha, and saw above her head
that long brown hand wave ever so slightly to
the left as she tossed her hair back. She braced
herself, and just as Martha made a dash to the
right, Theodora let her go and flew to the left.
She went too far, but even as Martha dashed
up behind her and put up her hands, Theodora
jumped, caught the ball with her left hand
and with her right hit it a ringing blow that
sent it straight over to the other basket. It
hit Alison Greer's head as she rushed toward
it, and while she was raising her hand Grace
Farwell snatched it from her shoulder, glanced
desperately at the Home, who had lost them
two balls, and bounded across, throwing the
ball before her. The roar of delight from the
freshmen was literally deafening, and as Grace
put it into the basket it seemed to Theodora
that the roof would surely drop.</p>

<p>"Six to one and the first half's up," said
somebody, and Theodora was pushed along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
with the Team&mdash;<i>her</i> team&mdash;into the sanctum
of their rest. But as they neared the door,
the applause became a song, and before she
quite understood what the verse was, it rang
out above her head:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Here's to <i>Theo</i>dora <i>Root</i>,</p>
<p class="i4">She's our <i>dandy</i> substi<i>toot</i>,</p>
<p>Drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>down</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Any one who has never been a subject of
song to some hundreds of young women cannot
perhaps understand why the mention of
one's name in flattering doggerel should be
so distinctly and immediately affecting. But
any one who has had that experience knows
the little contraction of the heart, the sudden
hot tightening of the eyelids, the confused,
excited desire to be worthy of all that trust
and admiration. It is to be doubted if Theodora
ever again felt so ideally, impersonally
devoted to any cause, so pathetically eager to
"make them proud of her."</p>

<p>In the little room the Team dropped on the
floor and panted. The coaches bustled in with
water, shook the hand of the new Guard and
told her to lie flat and not talk. A strong odor
of spirits filled the room, and Theodora, turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
her head languidly&mdash;for she felt very tired
all at once&mdash;saw that one of the juniors was
rubbing somebody with whiskey. Grace was
nursing an elbow and excitedly asking everybody
to sit on Alison Greer: "She works her elbow
right <i>into</i> you! She runs you right down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there!" said one of the juniors,
"never mind, never mind, Gracie! She's a
slugger, if you like, but you've got to beat
her! Don't be afraid of her."</p>

<p>"It's no good," said the Home that had
missed two balls, "we're too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough of that," interrupted the
coach who was fanning Virginia Wheeler.
"You're playing finely, girls. Now all you've
got to do is to make up your five goals. Don't
you see how low you've kept it down? You
did some fine centre work. Last year it was
eight to something the first half. You tried
to put it in standing right under the basket,
Mary&mdash;stand off and take your time."</p>

<p>They trotted out to the music of the sophomore
prize song. It was a legacy from the
seniors, who had themselves inherited it. It
leaped out at them&mdash;a mocking, dancing, derisive
little tune to which everybody kept
time.</p>

<p>It was repeated indefinitely, and at every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
repetition it went faster and more furious, and
strangers who had not heard it laughed louder
and louder.</p>

<p>Grace smiled grimly. The Team remembered
her words just before the door opened.</p>

<p>"Girls, it isn't likely that we'll win, <i>but we
can give 'em something to beat</i>!"</p>

<p>And as the ball went back and forth and
could not get free of the centre, the sophomores
realized that they had "something to
beat." The freshmen had somehow lost their
fear; they smiled up at their friends and grinned
cheerfully at their losses, which is far better
than to try to look unconscious. A little bow-legged
girl with a large nose and red knuckles
accomplished wonders in the centre, and won
them their second basket by stooping abruptly
and rolling the ball straight between Kate Sutton's
feet to Grace, who sat upon it and threw
it so hard at Alison Greer that it bounded
out of her hands and was promptly caught by
Virginia Wheeler and put into the basket.
This feat of Grace's was due entirely to her
having quite lost her head, but it passed as the
most daring of man&oelig;uvres, and received such
wild applause that Miss Kassan very nearly
stopped the game.</p>

<p>"What <i>shall</i> I do? This is terrible. I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
<i>heard</i> such noise as the freshmen are making!"
she mourned, with an apprehensive glance at
the platform. At that moment the ball soared
high, fell, was sent up again, and caught by a
phenomenal leap on the part of the little bow-legged
girl, who got it into the basket before
the Home knew what was happening. The
war broke out again, and Miss Kassan beheld
two members of the Faculty pounding with
their canes on the platform.</p>

<p>"Did you see her jump? George! That was
a good one! Did you see that, Robbins?"</p>

<p>But Robbins was standing up in his interest
and cheering under his breath as Martha Sutton
snatched a ball clearly intended for some
one else, quietly put it in the basket, and smiled
politely at her enthusiastic friends.</p>

<p>"Lord! What a Fullback she'd make!" he
muttered, as Alison charged down into the
centre. The lavender shadows under her eyes
were deep violet now; her mouth was pressed
to a scarlet line; her eyes were fixed on the
ball like gray stars. People seemed to melt
away before her: she never turned to right or
left.</p>

<p>Theodora saw nothing, heard nothing but
the slap of hands on the ball, the quick breaths
that slipped past her cheek. She knew that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
score was nine to five now; a little later it was
nine to six. She caught the eye of the girl in the
toque: she was standing now, her cheeks very
red, and the little lace handkerchief was torn
to shreds in her hands.</p>

<p>"Does she really care?" thought Theodora,
as she jumped and twisted and doubled.
Back on the senior side sat Susan Jackson,
her eyes wide, her lips parted; Cornelia Burt
was breathing on her hands and chafing them
softly. "Nine to seven&mdash;play!" called the assistant.</p>

<p>Harriet sat near the fireplace, her bandaged
foot on a bench before her, her hands twisting
and untwisting in her lap.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4"><i>Here's</i> to Harriet <i>Foster</i>,</p>
<p class="i4">And we're <i>sorry</i> that we <i>lost</i> her,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>sang the freshmen. Would Harriet have done
better? Would she have&mdash;Ah!</p>

<p>"Ten to seven&mdash;play!"</p>

<p>And they were so near, too! They <i>were</i>
playing well&mdash;Grace and Virginia were great&mdash;they
could have done something if that
stupid Home&mdash;Oh!</p>

<p>Theodora leaped, missed the ball, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
danced up in front of Martha and warded off
the girl who slipped in to help her. Martha
uttered an impatient exclamation and scowled.
The freshmen howled and kicked against the
gallery, and as the freshman Home woke out
of an apparent lethargy and put the ball in
neatly Theodora clapped and cheered with
the rest.</p>

<p>"Ten to eight&mdash;play!"</p>

<p>There was a scuffle, a fall, and a hot discussion.
Two girls grasped the ball, and the
captains hesitated. Miss Kassan ran up, and
in the little lull Theodora heard from the
platform:</p>

<p>"Oh, give it to the freshmen! They deserve
it!"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Greer had it!"</p>

<p>"She knocked the girl off it, if that's
what&mdash;" A rebellious howl from the yellow
gallery as Miss Greer bore off the ball, and
a man's voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! If you don't want 'em to
howl, don't let 'em play! The idea&mdash;to get
'em all worked up and then say: 'No, young
ladies, control yourselves!' How idiotic! I
don't blame 'em&mdash;I'd howl myself&mdash;Jiminy
crickets! <i>Look</i> at that girl! Good work! <i>Good
work!</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"Eleven to eight&mdash;play!"</p>

<p>"Good old Suttie! Good girl! Ninety-gre-e-e-en!"</p>

<p>Theodora's mouth was dry, and she ran
to the coach for a lemon. The junior's hand
shook, and her voice was husky from shouting.</p>

<p>"It's grand&mdash;it's grand!" she said quickly.
"Martha's mad as a hatter! See her braid!"</p>

<p>Martha had twisted her pale brown pigtail
tightly round her neck, and was calling with
little indistinct noises to her sister. Adah Levy
was talking to herself steadily and whispering,
"<i>Hurry now, hurry now, hurry now!</i>" as she
doubled and bent and worried the freshman
Home out of her senses. Grace Farwell was
everywhere at once, and was still only when
she fell backwards with a bang that sickened
the visiting mothers, and brought the freshmen's
hearts into their mouths. A great gasp
travelled up the gallery, and the doctor left her
seat, but before she reached the players Grace
was up, tossed her head, blinked rapidly, and
with an unsteady little smile took her place
by Alison Greer. And then the applause that
had gone before was mild in comparison with
the thunder from both galleries, and Miss
Kassan looked at her watch uneasily and
moved forward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>Now everybody was standing up, and the
men were pushing forward, and only the gasps
and bursts of applause and little cries of disappointment
disturbed the stillness&mdash;the
steady roar had stopped.</p>

<p>Theodora knew nothing, saw nothing: she
only played. Her back ached, and her throat
was dry; Martha's elbow moved like the piston
of a steam-engine; her arm, when Theodora
pressed against it, was like a stiff bar; she towered
above her Guard. It was only a question
of a few, few minutes&mdash;<i>could</i> they make it
"eleven to nine"?</p>

<p>She must have asked the question, for
Martha gasped, "No, you won't!" at her,
and her heart sank as Miss Kassan moved
closer. The ball neared their basket; the little
bow-legged girl ducked under Alison's nose
and emerged with it from a chaos of swaying
Centres, tossed it to Grace, who dashed to the
basket&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Time's up!</i>"</p>

<p>The freshmen shrieked, the Team yelled
to its captain: "Put it in! put it in!" The
sophomore Guards had not heard Miss Kassan,
and Grace poised the ball. A yell from
the freshmen&mdash;and she deliberately dropped
it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"Time's up," she said, with a little break
in her voice, and as Miss Kassan hurried forward
to stop the play she gave her the ball.
Through the tumult a bass voice was heard:
"I say, you know, that was pretty decent!
I'm not sure I'd have done that myself!"</p>

<p>And as the assistant and Miss Kassan retired
to compare fouls, and the noise grew
louder and louder, the freshman team, withdrawn
near the platform, heard a young professor,
not so many years distant from his own
alma mater, enthusiastically assuring any one
who cared to hear, that "That girl was a dead
game sport, now!"</p>

<p>For a moment the feeling against Grace
had been bitter&mdash;the basket was so near! But
as the sophomores were openly commending
her, and as Miss Kassan was heard to say
that the Team had played in splendid form
and had given a fine example of "the self-control
that the game was supposed to teach,"
they thought better of their captain with every
minute.</p>

<p>"Eleven to eight, in favor of Ninety-green&mdash;fouls
even!" said Miss Kassan, and the
storm broke from the gallery. But before it
reached the floor, almost, Martha was energetically
beating time, and above the miscellaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
babble rose the strong, steady cheer
of the sophomores:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!</p>
<p>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!</p>
<p>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!&mdash;Ninety-ye-e-e-e-llow!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Quick, girls! quick!" cried Grace, for
Miss Kassan was running toward them with
determination in her eye.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!</p>
<p>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!</p>
<p>'Rah, 'rah, 'rah!&mdash;Ninety-gre-e-e-e-n!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then it was all a wild, confused tumult.
Theodora had no distinct impressions; people
kissed her and shook her hand, and Kathie
Sewall carried Grace off to a swarm of girls
who devoured her, but not before Martha,
breathless from a rapid ride around the floor
on the unsteady shoulders of her loyal team,
had solemnly extended her hot brown hand
to the freshman captain and said, with sincere
respect, "That was as good a freshman
game as ever was played, Miss Farwell&mdash;we're
mighty proud of ourselves! Your centre
work was simply great! And&mdash;and of
course we know that that last goal was&mdash;was
practically yours!"</p>

<p>Theodora had expected to feel so ashamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
and sad&mdash;and somehow she was so proud and
happy! The sophomores last year had locked
themselves in for one hour and&mdash;expressed
their feelings; but the freshmen could only
realize that theirs was the closest score known
for years, and that they had made it against
the best team the college had ever seen; that
Martha had said that in fifteen minutes more,
at the rate they were playing, nobody knew
what might have happened; that Miss Kassan
had said that except in the matter of noise she
had been very proud of them; and that Professor
Robbins had called their captain a
Dead Game Sport!</p>

<p>It would not have been etiquette to carry
Grace about the hall, but they managed to
convey to her their feelings, which were far
from perfunctory, and in their enthusiasm
they went so far as to obey the Council's earnest
request that the decorations should remain
untouched. They cheered Theodora and
Virginia and Harriet and the bow-legged girl
till you would have supposed them victorious;
and when Harriet told Grace, with a little
gulp, that it was all up with her, for her
mother had said that a second sprained ankle
meant no more basket-ball, the little sympathetic
crowd brightened, and all eyes turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
to Theodora, who breathed hard and tried to
seem not to notice. Could it be? Would she
ever run out bouncing the ball in that waiting
hush?...</p>

<p>They were out of the Gym now, and only
the ushers' bonnets, the green and yellow
flowers that the Council had <i>not</i> controlled,
the crumpled, printed sheets of basket-ball
songs, and the little mascots posing for their
pictures on the campus made the day different
from any other.</p>

<p>"Come and lie down," said somebody, regarding
Theodora with a marked respect.
"You'll want to get rested before the dinner,
you know."</p>

<p>And as Theodora stared at her and half
turned to run after Grace, whom Kathie Sewall
was quietly leading off, the girl&mdash;she was
in the house with her&mdash;held her back.</p>

<p>"I'd let Grace alone, if I were you," she
said. "She's pretty well used up; she hurt
her elbow quite badly, but she wouldn't say
anything, and Dr. Leach says she'll have to
keep perfectly quiet if she wants to be at the
dinner&mdash;wants to! the idea! But she said <i>of
course</i> you were to come. They say they're
going to take some of the Gym decorations
down.&mdash;What! Why, the idea! <i>Of course</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
you'll go! You're sure to make the Team,
anyhow, for that matter! I tell you, Theodora,
we're proud of you! It wasn't any joke
to step in there and guard Martha Sutton
with a score of six to nothing!"</p>

<p>Theodora paused at the steps, her mackintosh
half off, her hair tangled about her crimson
cheeks, her sleeve dusty from that last
mad slide.</p>

<p>"No," she said, with a wave of reminiscence
of that sick shaking of her knees, that
shrinking from a million critical eyes. "No,
it wasn't any joke&mdash;not in the least!"</p>

<p>And she climbed up the stairs to a burst
of applause from the freshmen in the house
and the shrill cry of her room-mate:</p>

<p>"Come on, Theo! I've got a bath-tub
for you!"

<p class="stories">II<br />

A CASE OF INTERFERENCE</p>

<p>"What I want to know," said
the chairman of the committee,
wearily, "is just this. Are we going
to give the <i>Lady of Lyons</i>,
or are we not? I have a music lesson at four
and a tea at five, and while your sprightly and
interesting conversation is ever pleasing to
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Neal, don't! Think of something for
us! Don't you want us to give it?"</p>

<p>"I think it's too love-making. And no one
up here makes love. The girls will howl at
that garden scene. You must get something
where they can be funny."</p>

<p>"But, Neal, dear, <i>you</i> can make beautiful
love!"</p>

<p>"Certainly I can, but I can't make it alone,
can I? And Margaret Ellis is a stick&mdash;a perfect
stick. But then, have it! I see you're bent
on it. Only I tell you one thing&mdash;it will take
more rehearsing than the girls will want to
give. And I shan't do one word of it publicly
till I think that we have rehearsed enough
together. So that's all I've got to say till
Wednesday, and I <i>must</i> go!"</p>

<p>The door opened&mdash;shut; and before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
committee had time for comment or criticism,
their chairman had departed.</p>

<p>"Neal's a trifle cross," suggested Patsy,
mildly. "Something's the matter with her,"
said Julia Leslie. "She got a note from Miss
Henderson this afternoon, and I think she's
going to see her now. Oh, I haven't the
vaguest idea&mdash;What? No, I know it's not
about her work. Neal's all straight with that
department. Well, I think I'll go over to the
Gym and hunt out a suit. Who has the key
to the property box now?"</p>

<p>The little group dissolved rapidly and No. 18
resumed its wonted quiet. "There's nothing
like having a society girl for a room-mate, is
there, Patsy?" said the resident Sutton twin,
opening the door. She and her sister were distinguishable
by their room-mates alone, and
they had been separated with a view to preventing
embarrassing confusion, as they were
incredibly alike. "Couldn't I make the Alpha
on the strength of having vacated this hearth
and home eighteen times by actual count for
its old committees?"</p>

<p>"I've put you up five times, Kate, love, but
they think your hair's too straight. Couldn't
you curl it?"</p>

<p>Kate sniffed scornfully. "I've always known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
that the literary societies had some such system
of selection," she said to the bureau.
"Now, in an idle moment of relaxation, the
secret is out! Patsy, I <i>scorn</i> the Alpha, and the
Phi Kappa likewise."</p>

<p>"I scorn the Phi Kappa myself, theoretically,"
said Patsy.</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll take in that queer
junior, you know, that looks so tall till you
get close to her, and then it's the way she
walks?"</p>

<p>"Dear child, your vivid description somehow
fails to bring her to my mind."</p>

<p>"Why don't you want her in Alpha? But be
careful you don't wait too long! You're both
leaving me till late in the year, you know, and
then, ten to one, the other one gets me!"</p>

<p>"A little violet beside a mossy stone is a
poor comparison, Katharine, but at the moment
I think of no other. I am glad you grasp
the situation so clearly, though."</p>

<p>"But, truly, I wonder why they don't take
that girl&mdash;isn't her name Hastings?&mdash;into
Phi Kappa? She writes awfully well, they say,
and I guess she recites well enough."</p>

<p>The other Sutton twin sauntered in, and
appearing as usual to grasp the entire conversation
from the beginning, rolled her sister off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the couch, filled her vacant place, and entered
the discussion.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, you know she won't
make either society! She's too indifferent&mdash;she
doesn't care enough. And she's off the
campus, and she doesn't go out anywhere,
and she is always alone, and that speaks for
itself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm tired of talking about her! Stop
it, Kate, and get some crackers, that's a dear!
Or I'll get them myself," and Patsy was in
the hall.</p>

<p>Kate shook her head wisely at the bureau.
"Something's in the air," she said softly.
"Patsy is bothered. So is Neal. And there
are plenty of crackers on the window-seat!"</p>

<p>Miss Margaret Sewall Pattison sauntered
slowly down the stairs. For one whose heart
was set on crackers she seemed strangely indifferent
to the hungry girls standing about
the pantry with fountain pens and lecture
books and racquets and hammocks under
their arms. She walked by them and out of
the door, stood a moment irresolutely on the
porch, and then, as she caught sight of Cornelia
Burt coming out of the dormitory just
beyond, she hurried out to meet her.</p>

<p>"Busy this hour, Neal?" she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Cornelia, briefly. "Where shall
we go?"</p>

<p>"We can go to the property box and get
some clothes," said Patsy, "and talk it over
there."</p>

<p>In the cellar of the gymnasium it was cool
and dim. The beams rose high above their
heads, and a musty smell of tarlatan and muslin
and cheese-cloth filled the air. Patsy sat
on an old flower-stand, and pushed Cornelia
down on a Greek altar that lay on its side with
a faded smilax wreath still clinging to it.</p>

<p>"What did she say to you, Neal?" she asked.</p>

<p>Neal looked at the floor. "She was lovely,
but I didn't half appreciate it. I was so bothered
and&mdash;vexed. Pat, I didn't know the
Faculty ever did this sort of thing, did you?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe they often do," said Patsy.
"Did she read that thing to you, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Patsy, that's a remarkable thing.
Do you know, when I went there I thought
she was going to call me down for taking off
the Faculty in that last Open Alpha. The
girls say she hates that sort of thing. You
know she always says just what she thinks.
And she said, 'I want to read you a little
story, Miss Burt, that happened to come into
my hands, and that has haunted me since.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you suppose <i>she</i> got hold of it?"
queried Patsy.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. I certainly
shouldn't pick her out to exhibit <i>my</i> themes
to!&mdash;I never saw them together."</p>

<p>"I think I saw them walking once&mdash;well,
go on!"</p>

<p>"'For the <i>Monthly</i>?' said I.</p>

<p>"'No,' said she. 'I think the author would
not consent to its publication.' And then she
read it to me. Pat, if that girl has suffered as
much as that, I don't see how she stays here."</p>

<p>"She's too proud to do anything else,"
said Patsy. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Then Miss Henderson said: 'I needn't
tell you the value of this thing from a literary
point of view, Miss Burt.'</p>

<p>"'No,' said I, 'you needn't.'</p>

<p>"'Very well,' said she; 'then I'll tell you
something else. Every word of it is true.'</p>

<p>"'I'm sorry,' said I."</p>

<p>"Oh, Neal! I cried when she read it to
me! I blubbered like a baby. And she was
so nice about it. But I hated her, almost, for
disturbing me so."</p>

<p>"Precisely. So I said: 'And what have you
read this to me for, Miss Henderson?' And
then she told me that the girl in the story was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Winifred Hastings. She has always lived with
older people and been a great pet and sort of
prodigy, you know, and was expected to do
great things here, and found herself lonely,
and was proud and didn't make friends, and
got farther away from the college instead of
nearer to it, and all that. And I said, 'I suppose
she's not the only one, Miss Henderson.'
And she looked at me so queerly.
'Mephistopheles said that,' said she."</p>

<p>"Oh! Neal! How could you? I&mdash;why are
you so cold and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unsympathetic? I don't know. We all
have the defects of our qualities, I suppose.
Miss Henderson was quite still for a moment,
looking at me. I felt like a fly on a pin. 'Why
do you try so hard to be cruel, Miss Burt?'
said she, finally. 'I think you have an immense
capacity for suffering and for sympathy. Is it
because you are afraid to give way to it?' And
I said, 'Exactly so, Miss Henderson. I never
go to the door when the tramps come.'</p>

<p>"'Neither did I, once,' said she, 'but I
found it was a singularly useless plan. You've
got to, some time, Miss Burt.'</p>

<p>"'That's what I've always been afraid of,
but I'm putting it off as long as I can,' said I.</p>

<p>"And then she told me that this was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
first time that she had done anything of this
kind for a long while. 'I don't believe in helping
people to their places, as a rule,' she said.
'They usually get what they deserve, I fancy.
But this is a peculiar case. You suppose she
is not the only one, Miss Burt? I hope there
are very few like her. I have never known of
a girl of her ability to lose everything that she
has lost. There are girls who are queer and
erratic and somewhat solitary and perhaps discontented,
but they get into a prominence of
their own and you call it a "divine discontent,"
and make them geniuses, and they get
a good deal out of it, after all. There are girls
who are queer and quick-tempered, but good
students, and devoted to a few warm friends,
and their general unpopularity doesn't trouble
them particularly. There are the social leaders,
who don't particularly suffer if they don't get
into a society, who are popular everywhere,
and get the good time they came for. But
Winifred Hastings has somehow missed all
these. She got started wrong, and she's gone
from bad to worse. She is not solitary by nature,
and yet she is more alone than the girls
who like solitude, even. She is not naturally
reserved, and yet she is considered more so
than almost any girl in college. I believe her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
to have great executive ability. I consider her
one of the distinctly literary girls in her class,&mdash;and
if there is anything in essentially "bad
luck," I do honestly believe that she is the
victim of it. Her characteristics are so balanced
and opposed to each other that she can't help
herself, and she does things that make her
seem what she is not. Her real self is in this
story. You can see the pathos of that!'"</p>

<p>Neal drew a long breath. "Did she say that
to you?" she concluded.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. She told me that she was
speaking to me as one of the social influences
of the college. I felt like a cross between Madame
de Staël and Ward McAllister, you
know. And then she spoke of the power we
have, the girls like me, and how a little help&mdash;oh,
Neal! it <i>does</i> mean a good deal, though!
I can't make people take this girl up, all
alone! The girls aren't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are! They're the merest sheep! If
you do it, they'll all follow you. That is, if
she's really worth anything. Of course, they
aren't fools."</p>

<p>"She sat on me awfully, though, Neal! I
said, 'I suppose you think we ought to have
her in Alpha, Miss Henderson.' She gave
me a look that simply withered me. 'My dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Miss Pattison,' said she, in that twenty-mile-away
tone, 'I am not in the habit of suggesting
candidates for either of the societies: I
must have made myself far from clear to you.'
And I apologized. But it's what she meant,
all the same!"</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Well, I suppose she's
right. It isn't everybody would have dared
to do that much. I respect her for it myself.
You are to launch her socially, I am to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neal Burt, I think you ought to be
ashamed! Didn't Miss Henderson tell you
how Winifred Hastings admired you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She said that I was the only girl in the
college whose friendship&mdash;Oh, dear! I wish
she had gone to Vassar, that girl! Heavens!
It's half-past three! I must go this minute.
Well, Patsy, we're honored, in a way. I don't
think Miss Henderson would talk to every
one as she has to us, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Patsy, gravely, "I don't. You
know, Neal, just as I was going, she said, 'Of
course you realize, Miss Pattison, that only
you and I and Miss Burt have seen this story?'
'I understand,' said I. 'Perhaps I have done
this because I understand Miss Hastings better
than she thinks,' she said. 'I&mdash;I was a little
like her, myself, once, Miss Pattison!'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Neal, "she told me that."</p>

<p>"I don't see why Miss Henderson doesn't
take her up herself, if she understands her so
terribly well," scowled Patsy. "She looks just
like the kind of girl to be devoted to one person
and all that, you know. Miss Henderson
could go for walks with her and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too much sense!" said Neal, briefly.
"She wants to get her in with the girls. That
sort of thing would kill her with the girls, and
she knows it."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother! Look at B. Kitts&mdash;she's a
great friend of Miss Henderson's, and look
at yourself!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Neal returned decidedly.
"Biscuits was in with your set long before she
got to know Miss Henderson, and I knew
Marion Hunter at home before she came up
here. It's all very well to chum with the Faculty
if you're in with the girls, too, but otherwise&mdash;as
my friend Claude says, Nay, nay,
Pauline! Besides, Miss Henderson doesn't
go in for that sort of thing anyhow&mdash;she's
too clever."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I suppose it <i>is</i> best for us to do
it. I guess she's right enough," said Patsy,
rising as she spoke, "and I suppose we can
do it as well as anybody, for that matter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>They mounted the stone steps and came
out into a light that dazzled them. "There
she is!" said Patsy softly, as a tall girl, plainly
dressed, walked quickly by them. Her face
was strangely set, her mouth almost hard, her
eyes looked at them with an expression that
would have been defiant but for something
that softened them as they met Neal's. She
bowed to her, hardly noticing Patsy's "Good
afternoon, Miss Hastings!" and hurried off
to the back campus. Behind were two freshmen
loaded with pillows. "Isn't that Miss
Hastings?" said one.</p>

<p>"Yes. She's going to leave college."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, we can lose her better than
some others I could mention," said the prettier
and better dressed of the two. Then,
catching sight of Patsy and Neal, she stopped
and blushed a little. "Did&mdash;did you get my
note, Miss Burt? Will you come?" she asked
prettily. Neal smiled.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I shall be pleased&mdash;at four on
Saturday, I think you said?" And then as
the two moved on she added, "I heard you
say something about Miss Hastings: is it true
she's going to leave?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other freshman, importantly.
"Immediately, she told Mrs. White.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
I'm in the house with her. I think she said
next week. She's disappointed in college, I
guess. Well, I should think she would be.
She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I trust the college has given her no reason
to be," said Neal, gravely. "I sometimes think
her attitude&mdash;if that should happen to be her
attitude&mdash;somewhat justifiable." And before
the freshman could recover, Miss Burt and
her friend were halfway across the campus.</p>

<p>Patsy sighed with admiration. "Oh, Cornelia,
how I reverence you!" she said. "I couldn't
do that to save my soul. No. Once I tried it,
and the freshman laughed at me. I slunk
away&mdash;positively slunk."</p>

<p>But Neal did not laugh. "I can't see what
to do," she half whispered, as if to herself.
"Next week&mdash;next week! Why then, why
then, it's all over with her. She's thrown up
the sponge!"</p>

<p>Patsy peered into Cornelia's face and caught
her breath. "Why, Neal, do you care? Do
you really care?" she said. Neal looked at
her defiantly through wet lashes. "Yes, I do
care. I think it's horrible. To have her beaten
like this!&mdash;I have to go now. Be sure to come
to Alpha to-night!"</p>

<p>"When Cornelia leaves, she leaves sudden,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
said Kate Sutton, from the window. "Coming
up?"</p>

<p>Patsy stamped slowly up the two flights,
and rummaged in a very mussy window-box
for a silk waist. Her room-mate listened for
some expression of grief or joy to give the tone
to conversation, but none came; so she began
on her own account.</p>

<p>"Martha says," indicating her twin, who
was polishing the silver things with alcohol
and a preparation fondly believed by her to be
whiting, but which incessant use had reduced
to a dirty gritty gum, "Martha says she knows
who's going in to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She says it's Eleanor Huntington
and Leila Droch. She knows for certain."</p>

<p>"Great penetration she has&mdash;they've never
been mentioned," returned the senior, absent-mindedly,
grabbing under the chiffonier for
missing hair-pins.</p>

<p>A shriek of triumph from the twins brought
her to her knees.</p>

<p>"Aha! I told you they weren't in it! Perhaps
you'll believe me again! Perhaps I can't
find out a thing or two!"</p>

<p>The twins shook hands delightedly, and
Patsy, irritated at her slip, grabbed again for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the hair-pins, incidentally discovering a silver
shoe-horn and a fountain pen.</p>

<p>"Very clever you are&mdash;very," she remarked
coldly. "Quite unusual, and so young, too. No
wonder your parents are worried!"</p>

<p>This was a bitter cut, for the twins were industriously
engaged in living down the report
that the Registrar had in their freshman year
received a note from Mrs. Sutton imploring
her to curb if necessary their passion for study,
which invariably brought on nervous headaches.
This was peculiarly interesting to their
friends, who had never remarked any undue
application on their part and were, of course,
proportionately eager to caution them against
it. They squirmed visibly now and changed
their tone abruptly.</p>

<p>"They say that Frances Wilde was terribly
disappointed about making Alpha&mdash;she'd
much rather have got Phi Kappa," said Kate,
with a mixture of malice and humility.</p>

<p>Patsy was silent. Martha grinned and took
up the conversation.</p>

<p>"But her heart would have been broken if
she hadn't gotten in this year," she returned
amiably.</p>

<p>Patsy turned and glared at them, one arm
in the silk waist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"What utter nonsense!" she broke out.
"As if it made any matter, one way or the
other! As if it made two cents' worth of difference!
You know perfectly well that it's no
test at all&mdash;making a society. Look at the
girls who are in! It's a farce, as Neal says&mdash;"
She stopped and scowled at them defiantly.
The twins gasped. This from a society girl to
them, as yet unelect! Even for a conversation
with the Sutton twins, with whom, owing to
their own contagious example, truth was bound
to fly out sooner or later, this was unusual. It
was odd enough to discuss the societies at all
with perfectly eligible sophomores who might
reasonably expect to enter one or another sometime
and who were nevertheless yet uncalled;
but the twins discussed everything with everybody,
utterly regardless of etiquette, tradition,
or propriety, and their upper-classroom-mates
had long ago given up any ideas of reserve and
discipline they might have held.</p>

<p>Martha gasped but promptly replied.
"That's all very well for Cornelia Burt," she
said, with the famous Sutton grin. "Anybody
who made the Alpha in the first five and was
known well enough to have been especially
wanted in Phi Kappa and even begged to refuse&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you know that, Martha Sutton?"</p>

<p>"Oh! how did I? The President confided
it to me one day when he was calling. As I say,
Neal Burt and you can afford to talk; you can
say it's a bore and all that and make fun of the
meetings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't!"</p>

<p>"You do! I heard you growling about it to
Neal. And Bertha Kitts said she'd about as
soon conduct a class prayer-meeting as Phi&mdash;Oh,
not to me, naturally, but I know the girl
who heard the girl she said it to! Heard her
tell about it, I mean.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you, but you'd feel differently
if you were out! It's just like being
a junior usher. There are plenty of spooks
in, but there aren't many bright girls out.
Everybody knows that lots of the society girls
are pushed in by their friends and pulled in
for heaven knows what&mdash;certainly not brains!
But, just the same, you know well enough that
you can count on one hand all the girls in the
college that you'd think ought to be in and
aren't. You don't know anything about it, for
you were sure of it and everybody knew it,
but the ones that aren't, they're the ones that
worry! Why, I know sophomores to-day that
will cry all night if they don't get their notes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and their flowers and their front seat in chapel
Monday!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, indeed! Won't they, Katie?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" returned her sister, placidly.</p>

<p>"I guess Alison Greer will cry all right, if
she's not in!"</p>

<p>Patsy bit her lip and tapped her foot nervously.
Then she shrugged her shoulders and
opened the door, turning to remark, "You
don't seem to be wasted away, either of you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we! We're all right!" replied Martha,
comfortably. "We never expected it sophomore
year, anyhow. Nothing proddy about
us, you know. Too many clever girls in the
sophomore class, you see. But we expect to
amble in next year, we do. And violets from
you. And supper at Boyden's. Oh, yes! Don't
you worry about us, Miss Pattison, we're all
right!"</p>

<p>Miss Pattison sighed: sighs usually ended
one's conversations with the twins, for nothing
else so well expressed one's attitude.</p>

<p>"It's a pity you're so shrinking," she contented
herself with observing. "I'm afraid
you'll never come forward sufficiently to be
known well by either society!" And she went
down to get her mail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">II</p>

<p>There was a full meeting of the Alpha
that Saturday night. The vice-president
was lobbying energetically in behalf of a sophomore
friend who would prove the crown and
glory of the society, if all her upper-class patroness
said of her could possibly be true.
There was but one place open for the rest of
the term, for the society had grown unusually
that year, and some conservative seniors had
pressed hard on the old tradition that sixty was
a suitable and necessary limit, and put a motion
through to that effect, and every possible
junior had been elected long ago. So the vice-president
was distinctly hopeful. Amid the
buzz and clamor of fifty-odd voices, the president
slapped the table sharply. "<i>Will</i> the
meeting please come to order!" she cried. A
little rustle, and the handsome secretary arose.
"The regular meeting of the Alpha Society
was held&mdash;" and the report went on.</p>

<p>"Are there any objections to this report?"
asked the president, briskly. "Yes. It's far too
long," muttered Suzanne Endicott, flippantly.
The president looked at her reproachfully,
and added, "If not, we will proceed to the
election of new members&mdash;I mean the new
member. As you probably know, there is but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
one place left, according to the recent amendment,
and I think that we will vote as usual
on the three that are before us, and elect the
one having the most affirmative ballots. Are
there any objections to this method?" There
were none. The vice-president glanced appealingly
at the girl she was not quite sure of
and smiled encouragingly at the sophomore
she had successfully intimidated. The secretary
rose again. "The names to be voted on
this evening are Alison Greer, '9-, Katharine
Sutton, '9-, Marion Dustin, '9-," she
announced. "I may add that Miss Sutton has
the highest marks from the society, and that
if we don't take her this time there is very
little doubt that Phi Kappa Psi will. They'll
be afraid to risk another meeting."</p>

<p>"That's true," said somebody, as the buzzing
began again. "We're carrying this point
a little too far. I declare, it's harder to decide
on the people that aren't prods than anybody
would imagine. We know we want 'em sometime,
but we put it off so long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kate Sutton's awfully bright! I think she
should have been here before. I've been
trembling for fear we'd lose her by waiting
so long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still, Marion is <i>such</i> a dear, and it's pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
late for a girl that's been known so well for
so long, without getting in, it seems to me,"
said the vice-president, skilfully. "Why
didn't she get in before if she was so bright?"</p>

<p>"And there's Martha, too. They're just
alike. I think Martha's a little brighter, if
anything. Shall we have to take 'em both?"</p>

<p>"No. The girls all say to give her to Phi
Kappa, and tell 'em apart by the pins!"</p>

<p>"Like babies!"</p>

<p>"How silly!"</p>

<p>"To be perfectly frank, Miss Leslie, I
must say I don't think so. Alison is an awfully
dear girl, and all that, but I hardly think
she represents the element we hope to get into
Alpha. I'm sorry to say so, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The voting has begun," said the president.
"Will you hurry, please?"</p>

<p>"Miss President," said Cornelia Burt, rising
abruptly, "may I speak to the society before
the voting?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Miss Burt," said the president.
There was an instant hush, and the girls
stood clustered about the ballot-table in their
pretty, light dresses&mdash;a charming sight, Neal
thought vaguely, as she hunted for the words
to say.</p>

<p>"I know perfectly well that what I am about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
to propose is quite unconstitutional," she began,
and to her own ears her voice seemed far
off. How many there were, and how surprised
and attentive they looked! They were no fools,
as she had said. They represented the cleverest
element in the college, on the whole, and
they had, naturally enough, their own designs
and inclinations&mdash;why should they be turned
from them in a moment?</p>

<p>"I know that no girl is eligible for voting
upon until she has been read two meetings
before, and been properly put up for membership,
and all that," said Neal, quietly, with
her eyes fixed on Patsy's, who tried to evade
them. Poor Patsy. She wanted Kate to get the
society in her sophomore year! "But I am
in possession of certain facts that seem to me
to warrant the breaking through the constitution,
if such a thing can ever be done."</p>

<p>The silence had become intense. An ominous
look of surprise deepened on the girls'
faces, and the president looked doubtfully at
the secretary.</p>

<p>"I think I am quite justified in believing
that I have not the reputation of a sentimental
person," said Cornelia. She had herself well
in hand, now. The opposition that she felt
nerved her to her customary self-possession.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
A little grin swept around the room. She was,
apparently, quite justified.</p>

<p>"I have been in the Alpha as long as any
one here," said Neal, quietly still, "and in
all this time I have never proposed any one
for membership in it. I have voted whenever
I knew anything about the person in question,
and I have never blackballed but once. I
think I may say I have done my share of
work for the society&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a unanimous murmur of deep
and unqualified assent. "You have done more
than your share," said the president, promptly.</p>

<p>"I mention these things," said Neal, "in
order that you may see that I recognize the
need of some apology for what I am about to
propose. I want to propose the name of Winifred
Hastings to-night, and have her voted
on with the rest. If it is a possible thing, I want
her elected. That she would be elected without
any doubt, I am certain, if only I could
put the facts of the case properly before you.
That she must be elected, now, to-night, is
absolutely necessary, for by another meeting
she will have left the college&mdash;left it for the
lack of just such recognition as membership
in the society will give her."</p>

<p>Cornelia Burt was a born orator. Never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
was she so happy as when she felt an audience,
however small, given over to her, eyes
and ears, for the moment. She stood straight
as a reed, and looked easily over their faces,
holding by very force of personality their attention.
She spoke without the slightest hesitation,
yet perfectly simply and after no set
form. Insensibly the girls around her felt conviction
in her very presence: they agreed with
her against their will, while she was speaking.</p>

<p>"Before I go any farther, I want to tell
you that Miss Hastings is no friend of mine,"
said Neal. "I hardly know her. Only lately
I have learned the circumstances that led me
to take this step. I feel that I must do this
thing. I feel that we are letting go from the
college a girl whose failure in life, if she fails,
will be in our hands. We can elect these others
later: Winifred Hastings leaves the college
next week. And, speaking as editor of the
college paper, I must say that she carries with
her some of the best literary material in the
college. You ask me why we have never seen
it&mdash;I tell you, because she is a girl who needs
encouragement, and she has never had it. She
can do her best only when it is called for.
Some of you may think you know her&mdash;may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
think that she is proud and solitary and disagreeable:
she is not. <i>This</i> is the real girl!"</p>

<p>And, stepping farther into the circle, Cornelia,
by an effort of memory she has never
equalled since, told them, with the simplest
eloquence, the pathetic story of Winifred
Hastings' life, as she had written it. She did
not comment&mdash;she only related. Her keen
literary appreciation had caught the most effective
parts, and she had the dramatic sense
to which every successful speaker owes so
much. Under her touch the haughty, solitary
figure of a scarcely known girl melted away
before them, and they saw a baffled, eager,
hungry soul that had fought desperately, and
was going silently away&mdash;beaten.</p>

<p>Cornelia Burt had made speeches before,
and she made them afterward, to larger and
more excited college audiences, but she never
held so many hearts in her hand as she did
that night. She was not a particularly unselfish
girl, but no one who heard her then ever
called her egotistic afterward. Her whole nature
was thrown with all its force into this
fight&mdash;for it was a fight.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nowhere an audience less
sentimental and more critical than a group of
clever college girls. They see clearly for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
most part, and, like all clever youth, somewhat
cruelly. They object to being ruled by any
but their chosen, and however they admired
her, Cornelia was not their chosen leader. It
was not because her speech was able, but because
it was so evident that she believed herself
only the means of preventing a calamity
that she was striving with all her soul to
avert, that she impressed them so deeply.</p>

<p>For she did impress them. When she ended,
it was very quiet in the room. "I have broken
a confidence in telling this," she said. "The
girl herself would rather die than have you
know it, I'm sure, and now&mdash;I feel afraid.
It has been a bold stroke; if I have lost, I
shall never forgive myself. But oh! I <i>cannot</i>
have her go!"</p>

<p>She sat down quickly and stared into her
lap. The spell of her voice was gone, the girls
looked at each other, and a tall, keen-eyed
girl with glasses got up. "I wish to say," she
said, "that while Miss Burt's story is terribly
convincing, still this may be a little exaggerated,
and, at any rate, think of the precedent!
If this should be done very often&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it won't be!" cried some one with a
somewhat husky voice, and Patsy rudely interrupted
the speaker. Dear Patsy! She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
crushed her handkerchief in her hand and
said good-by to Kate: she would have liked
to put her pin in Kate's shirt-waist, and now&mdash;now
Phi Kappa would get her! When Patsy
spoke, it was with the voice of eleven, for she
carried at least ten of the leading set in the
Alpha with her.</p>

<p>"I think we are all very glad to realize that
there won't be many such cases&mdash;most people
have compensations&mdash;we ought to be willing
to break the constitution again for such
a thing, anyhow&mdash;and, Miss President, I
move that Miss Hastings be voted upon by
acclamation!"</p>

<p>"I second the motion," said the vice-president,
quickly.</p>

<p>"It is moved and seconded that Miss Hastings
be voted upon by acclamation," said the
president. "All in favor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings has yet to be proposed,"
said some one, after the vote.</p>

<p>The president looked at Cornelia.</p>

<p>"I propose Winifred Hastings, '9-, as a
member of the Alpha Society," said Cornelia,
with flaming cheeks and downcast eyes. She
dared not look at them. Were they going
to punish her? She heard the motion announced,
she heard the name put up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"All in favor please signify by rising," said
the president, and only when the Alpha rose
in a body did Cornelia lift her eyes.</p>

<p>They were all looking at her, and she stepped
a little back.</p>

<p>"I cannot thank you," she said, so low that
they leaned forward to hear. "It was no affair
of mine, as I said. But&mdash;I think you&mdash;we&mdash;shall
never regret this election." And then
they applauded so loudly that the freshmen
on the campus could not forbear peeping under
the blinds to see what they were doing.
They saw only the president, however, as she
stepped back to the table and said with an air
of relief&mdash;for, after all, emotion is very wearing&mdash;"We
will now proceed to the literary
programme of the evening!"</p>

<p>"But Neal, dear," said Patsy, as they settled
themselves to listen, "do you think she'll
stay? (Oh, Neal! I'm so proud of you!)"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Patsy!" said Neal, rudely. Then,
as she thought of what Miss Henderson had
told her of Winifred Hastings: "You are the
only girl whose friendship"&mdash;she blushed.
Then, assuming a bored expression, she looked
at the girl who was reading. "I fear there's
no doubt she will!" said Cornelia Burt.

<p class="stories">III<br />

MISS BIDDLE OF BRYN MAWR</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have minded so much,"
explained Katherine, dolefully, and not
without the suspicion of a sob, "if it
wasn't that I'd asked Miss Hartwell
and Miss Ackley! I shall die of embarrassment&mdash;I
shall! Oh! why couldn't Henrietta
Biddle have waited a week before she went
to Europe?"</p>

<p>Her room-mate, Miss Grace Farwell, sank
despairingly on the pile of red floor-cushions
under the window. "Oh, Kitten! you didn't
ask them? Not really?" she gasped, staring
incredulously at the tangled head that peered
over the screen behind which Katherine was
splashily conducting her toilet operations.</p>

<p>"But I did! I think they're simply grand,
especially Miss Hartwell, and I'll never have
any chance of meeting her, I suppose, and I
thought this was a beautiful one. So I met her
yesterday on the campus and I walked up to
her&mdash;I was horribly scared, but I don't think
I showed it&mdash;and, said I, 'Oh, Miss Hartwell,
you don't know me, of course, but I'm Miss
Sewall, '9-, and I know Henrietta Biddle of
Bryn Mawr, and she's coming to see me for
two or three days, and I'm going to make a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
little tea for her&mdash;very informal&mdash;and I've
heard her speak of you and Miss Ackley as
about the only girls she knew here, and I'd
love to have you meet her again!'"</p>

<p>Miss Farwell laughed hysterically. "And
did she accept?" she inquired.</p>

<p>Katherine wiped her face for the third time
excitedly. "Oh, yes! She was as sweet as peaches
and cream! 'I shall be charmed to meet Miss
Biddle again, and in your room, Miss Sewall,'
she said, 'and shall I bring Miss Ackley?' Oh,
Grace, she's lovely! She is the most&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've no doubt," interrupted Miss
Farwell, cynically; "all the handsome seniors
are. But what are you going to say to her to-day?"</p>

<p>Katherine buried her yellow head in the
towel. "I don't know! Oh, Grace! I don't
know," she mourned. "And they say the
freshmen are getting so uppish, anyway, and
if we carry it off well, and just make a joke of
it, they'll think we're awfully f-f-fresh!" Here
words failed her, and she leaned heavily on the
screen, which, as it was old and probably resented
having been sold third-hand at a second-hand
price, collapsed weakly, dragging
with it the Bodenhausen Madonna, a silver
rack of photographs, and a Gibson Girl drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
in very black ink on a very white ground.</p>

<p>"And if we are apologetic and meek," continued
Miss Farwell, easily, apparently undisturbed
by the confusion consequent to the
downfall of a piece of furniture known to be
somewhat erratic, "they'll laugh at us or be
bored. We shall be known as the freshmen
who invited seniors and Faculty and town-people
to meet&mdash;nobody at all! A pretty reputation!"</p>

<p>"But, Grace, we couldn't help it! Such
things will happen!" Katherine was pinning
the Gibson Girl to the wall, in bold defiance
of the matron's known views on that subject.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. But they mustn't happen
to freshmen!" her room-mate returned sententiously.
"How many Faculty did you ask?"</p>

<p>"I asked Miss Parker, because she fitted
Henrietta for college, at Archer Hall, and I
asked Miss Williams, because she knows
Henrietta's mother&mdash;Oh! Miss Williams
will freeze me to death when she comes here
and sees just us!&mdash;and I asked Miss Dodge,
because she knows a lot of Bryn Mawr people.
Then Mrs. Patton on Elm Street was a
school friend of Mrs. Biddle's, and&mdash;oh!
Grace, I <i>can't</i> manage them alone! Let's tell
them not to come!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"And what shall we do with the sandwiches?
And the little cakes? And the lemons
that I sliced? And the tea-cups and
spoons I borrowed? And that pint of extra
thick cream?" Miss Farwell checked off these
interesting items on her fingers, and kicked
the floor-cushions to point the question.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know! Isn't there any
chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, goosey, there isn't. See here!" Grace
pulled down a letter with a special delivery
stamp from the desk above her head, and
read with emphasis:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>DEAR Kitten,&mdash;Just a line to say that Aunt
Mary has sent for me at three days' notice to
go to Paris with her for a year. It's now or never,
you know, and I've left the college, and will come
back to graduate with '9-. So sorry I can't see
you before I go. Had looked forward to a very
interesting time, renewing my own freshman
days, and all that. Please send my blue cloth suit
right on to Philadelphia C. O. D. when it comes
to you. I hope you hadn't gotten anything up for
me.</i></p>

<p class="left45">
<i>With much love</i>,<br />
<span class="smcap left25">Henrietta Biddle</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bryn Mawr, March 5.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"I don't think there's much chance, my
dear."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Katherine, sadly, and with a
final pat administered to the screen, which still
wobbled unsteadily. "No, I suppose there
isn't. And it's eleven o'clock. They'll be
here at four! Oh! and I asked that pretty
junior, Miss Pratt, you know. Henrietta
knew her sister. She was in '8-."</p>

<p>"Ah," returned Miss Farwell, with a suspicious
sweetness, "why didn't you ask a few
more, Katherine, dear? What with the list we
made out together and these last extra ones&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I thought there wasn't any use having
the largest double room in the house, if
we couldn't have a decent-sized party in it!
And think of all those darling, thin little sandwiches!&mdash;Oh
well, we might just as well be
sensible and carry the thing through, Gracie!
But I am just as afraid as I can be: I tell you
that. And Miss Williams will freeze me stiff."
The yellow hair was snugly braided and wound
around by now, and a neat though worried
maiden sat on the couch and punched the
Harvard pillow reflectively.</p>

<p>"Never mind her, Kitten, but just go ahead.
You know Caroline Wilde said it was all right
to ask her if she was Miss Biddle's mother's
friend, and there wasn't time to take her all
around, and you know how nice Miss Parker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
was about it. We can't help it, as you say, and
we'll go and get the flowers as we meant to.
Have you anything this hour?"</p>

<p>With her room-mate to back her, to quote
the young lady herself, Miss Sewall felt equal
to almost any social function. Terrifying as her
position appeared&mdash;and strangely enough, the
seniors appalled her far more than the Faculty&mdash;there
was yet a certain excitement in the situation.
What should she say to them? Would
they be kind about it, or would they all turn
around and go home? Would they think&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" interrupted Grace the
practical, as these doubts were thrust upon
her. "If they're ladies, as I suppose they
are, of course they'll stay and make it just as
pleasant for us as they can. They'll see how
it is. Think what we'd do, ourselves, you
know!"</p>

<p>They went down the single long street, with
the shops on either side, a red-capped, golf-caped
pair of friends, like nine hundred other
girls, yet different from them all. And they
chattered of Livy and little cakes and Trigonometry
and pleated shirt-waists and basket-ball
and Fortnightly Themes like all the
others, but in their little way they were very
social heroines, setting their teeth to carry by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
storm a position that many an older woman
would have found doubtful.</p>

<p>They stopped at a little bakery, well down
the street, to order some rolls for the girl
across the hall from them, who had planned
to breakfast in luxury and alone on chocolate
and grape-fruit the next morning. "Miss Carter,
24 Washburn," said Grace, carelessly,
when Katherine whispered, "Look at her!
Isn't that funny? Why, Grace, just see her!"</p>

<p>"See who&mdash;whom, I mean? (only I hate to
say 'whom.') Who is it, Kitten?"</p>

<p>Katherine was staring at the clerk, a tall,
handsome girl, with masses of heavy black
hair and an erect figure. As she went down
to the back of the shop again, Katherine's
eyes followed her closely.</p>

<p>"It's that girl that used to be in the Candy
Kitchen&mdash;don't you remember? I told you
then that she looked so much like my friend
Miss Biddle. And then the Candy Kitchen
failed and I suppose she came here. And she's
just Henrietta's height, too. You know Henrietta
stands very straight and frowns a little,
and so did this girl when you gave Alice's number
and she said, 'Thirty-four or twenty-four?'
Isn't it funny that we should see her now?&mdash;Oh,
dear! If only she <i>were</i> Henrietta!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>Grace stared at the case of domestic bread
and breathed quickly. "Does she really look
like her, Kitten?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, indeed. It's quite striking. Henrietta's
quite a type, you know&mdash;nothing unusual,
only very dark and tall and all that. Of
course there are differences, though."</p>

<p>"What differences?" said Grace, still looking
intently at the domestic bread.</p>

<p>"Oh, Henrietta's eyes are brown, and this
girl's are black. And Henrietta hasn't any
dimple, and her hands are prettier. And Henrietta's
waist isn't so small, and she hasn't
nearly so much hair, I should say. But then,
I haven't seen her for a year, and probably
there's a greater difference than I think."</p>

<p>"How long is it since those seniors and the
Faculty saw Henrietta?" said Grace, staring
now at a row of layer chocolate-cakes.</p>

<p>Her room-mate started. "Why&mdash;why,
Grace, what do you mean? It's two years,
Henrietta wrote, I think. And Miss Parker
and Miss Williams haven't seen her for much
longer than that. But&mdash;but&mdash;you don't mean
anything, Grace?"</p>

<p>Grace faced her suddenly. "Yes," she said,
"I do. You may think that because I just go
right along with this thing, I don't care at all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
But I do. I'm awfully scared. I hate to think
of that Miss Ackley lifting her eyebrows&mdash;the
way she will! And Miss Hartwell said once
when somebody asked if she knew Judge Farwell's
daughter, 'Oh, dear me&mdash;I suppose so!
And everybody else in her class&mdash;theoretically!
But practically I rarely observe them!'
Ugh! She'll observe me to-day, I hope!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I suppose she will. And me too.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! But if nobody knows how Miss
Biddle looks, and she was going to stay at the
hotel, anyway, and it would only be for two
hours, and everything would be so simple&mdash;"</p>

<p>Katherine's cheeks grew very red and her
breath came fast. "But would we dare? Would
she be willing? Would it be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, it's only a courtesy! And
everybody will think it's all right, and the
thing will go beautifully, and Miss Biddle, if
she has any sense of humor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! Henrietta would only be
amused&mdash;oh, so amused! And it would be
such a heavenly relief after all the worry. We
could send her off on the next train&mdash;Henrietta,
you know&mdash;and dress makes such a
difference in a girl!"</p>

<p>"And I think she would if we asked her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
just as a favor&mdash;it wouldn't be a question of
money! Oh, Katherine! I could cry for joy
if she would!"</p>

<p>"She'd like to, if she has any fun in her&mdash;it
would be a game with some point to it! And
will you ask her, or shall I?"</p>

<p>They were half in joke and half in earnest:
it was a real crisis to them. They were only
freshmen, and they had invited the seniors
and the Faculty. And two of the most prominent
seniors! Whom they hadn't known at
all! They had a sense of humor, but they were
proud, too, and they had a woman's horror of
an unsuccessful social function. They felt that
they were doomed to endless joking at the
hands of the whole college, and this apprehension,
though probably exaggerated, nerved
them to their <i>coup d'état</i>.</p>

<p>Grace walked down the shop. "I will ask
her," she said.</p>

<p>Katherine stood with her back turned and
tried not to hear. Suppose the girl should be
insulted? Suppose she should be afraid? Now
that there was a faint hope of success, she realized
how frightened and discouraged she had
been. For it would be a success, she saw that.
Nobody would have had Miss Biddle to talk
with for more than a few minutes anyhow, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
had asked such a crowd. And yet she would
have been the centre of the whole affair.</p>

<p>"Katherine," said a voice behind her, "let
me introduce Miss Brooks, who has consented
to help us!"</p>

<p>Katherine held out her hands to the girl.
"Oh, thank you! <i>thank</i> you!" she said.</p>

<p>The girl laughed. "I think it's queer," she
said, "but if you are in such a fix, I'd just as
lief help you as not. Only I shall give you
away&mdash;I shan't know what to say."</p>

<p>Grace glanced at Katherine. Then she
proved her right to all the praise she afterward
accepted from her grateful room-mate. "That
will be very easy," she said sweetly. "Miss
Biddle, whom you will&mdash;will represent, speaks
very rarely: she's not at all talkative!"</p>

<p>Katherine gasped. "Oh, no!" she said
eagerly, "she's very statuesque, you know,
and keeps very still and straight, and just looks
in your eyes and makes you think she's talking.
She says 'Really?' and 'Fancy, now!' and 'I
expect you're very jolly here,' and then she
smiles. You could do that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I could do that," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Can you come to the hotel right after dinner?"
said Grace, competently, "and we'll cram
you for an hour or so on Miss Biddle's affairs."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>The girl laughed. "Why, yes," she said, "I
guess I can get off."</p>

<p>So they left her smiling at them from the
domestic bread, and at two o'clock they carried
Miss Henrietta Biddle's dress-suit case to
the hotel and took Miss Brooks to her room.
And they sat her on a sofa and told her what
they knew of her alma mater and her relatives
and her character generally. And she amazed
them by a very comprehensive grasp of the
whole affair and an aptitude for mimicry that
would have gotten her a star part in the senior
dramatics. With a few corrections she spoke
very good English, and "as she'd only have
to answer questions, anyhow, she needn't talk
long at a time," they told each other.</p>

<p>She put up her heavy hair in a twisted crown
on her head, and they put the blue cloth gown
on her, and covered the place in the front,
where it didn't fit, with a beautiful fichu that
Henrietta had apparently been led of Providence
to tuck in the dress-suit case. And she
rode up in a carriage with them, very much
excited, but with a beautiful color and glowing
eyes, and a smile that brought out the dimple
that Henrietta never had.</p>

<p>They showed her the room and the sandwiches
and the tea, and they got into their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
clothes, not speaking, except when a great box
with three bunches of English violets was left
at their door with Grace's card. Then Katherine
said, "You dear thing!" And Miss Brooks
smiled as they pinned hers on and said softly,
"Fancy, now!"</p>

<p>And then they weren't afraid for her any
more.</p>

<p>When the pretty Miss Pratt came, a little
after four, with Miss Williams, she smiled
with pleasure at the room, all flowers and tea
and well-dressed girls, with a tall, handsome
brunette in a blue gown with a beautiful lace
bib smiling gently on a crowd of worshippers,
and saying little soft sentences that meant anything
that was polite and self-possessed.</p>

<p>Close by her was her friend Miss Sewall,
of the freshman class, who sweetly answered
half the questions about Bryn Mawr that Miss
Biddle couldn't find time to answer, and
steered people away who insisted on talking
with her too long. Miss Farwell, also of the
freshman class, assisted her room-mate in receiving,
and passed many kinds of pleasant
food, laughing a great deal at what everybody
said and chatting amicably and unabashed
with the two seniors of honor, who openly
raved over Miss Biddle of Bryn Mawr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Katherine had said, "May I present
Miss Hartwell&mdash;Miss Ackley?" they
took their stand by the stately stranger and
talked to her as much as was consistent with
propriety.</p>

<p>"Isn't she perfectly charming!" they said
to Miss Parker, and "Yes, indeed," replied
that lady, "I should have known Netta anywhere.
She is just what I had thought she
would be!"</p>

<p>And Miss Williams, far from freezing the
pretty hostess, patted her shoulder kindly.
"Henrietta is quite worth coming to see," she
said with her best and most exquisite manner.
"I have heard of the Bryn Mawr style, and now
I am convinced. I wish all our girls had such
dignity&mdash;such a feeling for the right word!"</p>

<p>And they had the grace to blush. They
knew who had taught Henrietta Biddle Brooks
that right word!</p>

<p>At six o'clock Miss Biddle had to take the
Philadelphia express. She had only stopped
over for the tea. And so the girls of the house
could not admire her over the supper-table.
But they probably appreciated her more. For
after all, as they decided in talking her over
later, it wasn't so much what she said, as the
way she looked when she said it!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>But only a dress-suit case marked H. L. B.
took the Philadelphia express that night, and
a tall, red-cheeked girl in a mussy checked suit
left the hotel with a bunch of violets in her
hand and a reminiscent smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"We simply can't thank you; we haven't
any words. You've helped us give the nicest
party two freshmen ever gave, if it is any
pleasure to you to know that," said Katherine.
"And now you're only not to speak of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I shan't speak of it," said the
girl. "You needn't be afraid. Nobody that
I'd tell would believe me, very much, anyhow.
I'm glad I could help you, and I had
a lovely time&mdash;lovely!"</p>

<p>She smiled at them: the slow, sweet smile
of Henrietta Biddle, late of Bryn Mawr. "You
College ladies are certainly queer&mdash;but you're
smart!" said Miss Brooks of the bakery.

BISCUITS EX MACHINA</p>

<p>B. S. Kitts&mdash;this was the signature
she had affixed in a neat clerical backhand
to all her written papers since
the beginning of freshman year; and
she had of course been called Biscuits as soon
as she had found her own particular little set of
girls and settled down to that peculiar form of
intimacy which living in barracks, however advantageously
organized, necessitates. She had
a sallow irregular face, fine brown eyes surrounded
with tiny wrinkles, a taste for Thackeray,
and a keen sense of humor. It was the
last which was subsequently responsible for
this story about her.</p>

<p>She was quite unnoticed for two or three
years, which is a very good thing for a girl.
During that time she quietly took soundings
and laid in material, presumably, for those satiric
characterizations which were the terror of
her undergraduate enemies and the concealed
discomfort of those in high places. During her
junior year she began to be considered terribly
clever, and though she was never what is
known as a Prominent Senior, she had her little
triumphs here and there, and in the matter
of written papers she was a source of great comfort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
to those whom custom compels to demand
such tributes.</p>

<p>She was the kind of girl who, though well
known in her own class, is quite unobserved
of the lower classes, and this, if it deprived her
of the admirations and attentions bestowed on
the prominent, saved her the many worries and
wearinesses incident to trying to please everybody
at once&mdash;the business of the over-popular.
She had a great deal of time, which may
seem absurd, but which is really quite possible
if one keeps positively off committees, is neither
musical nor athletic, and shuns courses involving
laboratory work. It is of great assistance
also in this connection to elect English Literature
copiously, when one has read most of
the works in question and can send home for
the reference books, thus saving an immense
amount of fruitless loitering about crowded
libraries.</p>

<p>Biscuits employed the time thus gained in
a fashion apparently purposeless. She loafed
about and observed, with <i>Vanity Fair</i> under
one arm and an apple in the other hand. She
was never the subject or the object of a violent
friendship; she was one of five or six clever
girls who hung together consistently after
sophomore year, bickering amicably and indulging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
in mutual contumely when together,
defending one another promptly when apart.
The house president spoke of them bitterly
as blasé and critical; the lady-in-charge remarked
suspiciously the unusual chance which
invariably seated them together at the end
of the table at the regular drawing for seats;
the collector for missions found them sceptical
and inclined to ribaldry if pushed too far; but
the Phi Kappa banked heavily on their united
efforts, and more than usually idiotic class
meetings meekly bowed to what they themselves
scornfully referred to afterward as "their
ordinary horse-sense."</p>

<p>One of the members of this little group was
Martha Augusta Williams. Sometimes she retired
from it and devoted herself to solitude,
barely replying to questions and obscurely
intimating that to <i>ennui</i> such as hers the prattle
of the immature and inexperienced could
hardly be supposed even by themselves to be
endurable; sometimes she returned to it with
the air of one willing to impart to such a body
the mellow cynicism of a tolerant if fatigued
<i>femme du monde</i>. In the intervals of her retirement
she wrote furiously at long-due themes,
which took the form of Richard Harding
Davis stories&mdash;she did them very well&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
modern and morbid verses of a nature to disturb
the more conservative of those who heard
them. At any expression of disturbance Martha
would elaborately suppress a three-volume
smile and murmur something about
"meat for babes;" a performance which delighted
her friends&mdash;especially Biscuits&mdash;beyond
measure. Her shelves bristled with yellow
French novels, and on her bureau a great ivory
skull with a Japanese paper snake carelessly
twined through it impressed stray freshmen
tremendously. She cut classes elaborately and
let her work drop ostentatiously in the middle
of the term, appearing at mid-years with ringed
eyes and an air of toleration strained to the
breaking point. She slept till nine and wandered
lazily to coffee and toast at Boyden's
an hour later, at least three times a week, with
an air that would have done credit to one of
Ouida's noblemen.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all this, Martha was not
happy. The disapproval of the lady-in-charge,
the suspicions of the freshmen, the periodical
discussions with members of the Faculty, who
"regretted to be obliged to mark," etc., "when
they realized perfectly that she was capable,"
etc.,&mdash;all these alleviated her trouble a little,
but the facts remained that her own particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
set would never treat her seriously, and
that her name was Martha Augusta Williams.
Fancy feeling such feelings, and thinking such
thoughts, and bearing the name of Martha
Augusta Williams! It is, to say the least, dispiriting.
And nobody had ever called her anything
else. Harriet Williams was called, indifferently,
Billie and Willie and Sillie. Martha
Underhill took her choice of Mattie, Nancy,
and Sister. A girl whose name was Anna Augusta.
Something had been hailed as Gustavus
Adolphus from her freshman year on; but
below <i>her</i> most daring flights of fiction must
ever appear those three ordinary, not to say
stodgy, names. That alone would have soured
a temper not too inclined to regard life with
favor.</p>

<p>Martha might have lived down the name,
but she was assured that never while Bertha
Kitts remained alive would she be able to appear
really wickedly interesting. For Biscuits
would tell the Story. Tell it with variations
and lights and shades and explanations adapted
to the audience. And it never seemed to pall.
Yet it was simple&mdash;horribly simple.</p>

<p>Martha had invited a select body of sophomores
to go with her to the palm-reader's.
There were two clever ones, who vastly admired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
her Richard Harding Davis tales, two
curious ones, who openly begged for her opinions
and thrilled at her epigrams on Love
and Life and Experience, and, in an evil hour,
the Sutton twins, whom she admitted into the
occasion partly to impress them, and partly
so that if anything really fascinating should
come to light, Kate Sutton could impart it to
her room-mate, Patsy Pattison.</p>

<p>When they were assembled in the palm-reader's
parlor, Martha gravely motioned the
others to go before her, and they took their
innocent turns before the little velvet cushion.
The Twins were admirably struck off in
a few phrases, to the delight of their friends,
and the palm-reader's reputation firmly established.
In the case of one of the curious girls,
peculiar and private events were hinted at
that greatly impressed her, for "how <i>could</i>
she have known <i>that</i>, girls?" The clever girls
were comforted with fame and large "scribbler's
crosses," also wealthy marriages and social
careers, but they looked enviously at
Martha, nevertheless, and she smiled maternally
on them, as was right. There remained
only the other quiet little girl, and she modestly
suggested waiting till another day, "so
there'll be lots of time for yours, Miss Williams;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
but Martha smiled kindly and waved
her to the seat, suggesting that hers might
not be a long session, with an amused glance
at the empty, little pink palm.</p>

<p>The palm-reader turned and twisted and
patted and asked her age, and finally announced
that it was a remarkable hand. The
dying interest revived, and even Martha's
eyebrows went up with amazement as the seer
spoke darkly of immense influence; tact to
the <i>n</i>th degree; unusual amount of experience,
or at the least, "intuitional discoveries;" two
great artistic means of expression; previous
affairs of the heart, and an inborn capacity for
ruling the destinies of others&mdash;marked resemblance
to the hands of Cleopatra and Sara
Bernhardt. It was hands like that that moved
the world, she said. The sophomores regarded
their friend with interest and awe, noted that
she blushed deeply at portions of the revelation,
recollected her Sunday afternoon improvisations
at the piano and her request for a
more advanced course in harmony, and attached
a hitherto unfelt importance to her
heavy mails.</p>

<p>Martha may have regretted her politeness,
but she smothered her surprise, sank, with an
abstracted air, upon the chair before the cushion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
and with a face from which all emotion
had been withdrawn and eyes which defied
any wildest revelation to disturb their settled
<i>ennui</i>, awaited the event. The palm-reader
glanced at the back of the slim hand, noted
the face, touched the finger tips.</p>

<p>"How old are you, please?" she asked.
Martha wearily announced that she was
twenty-one. She was conscious of its being
a terribly ordinary age. The palm-reader
nodded. "Ah!" she said easily. "Well, come
to me again in a year or two. I can't really
tell much now."</p>

<p>Martha gasped at her. "You can't <i>tell</i>
much!"</p>

<p>The palm-reader took her hand again.
"There's nothing much to tell!" she explained.
"The hand isn't really developed
yet&mdash;it's the opposite from the last young
lady's, you might say."</p>

<p>She became conscious of a cold silence
through the room, and added a few details.
"There's a good general ability; no particular
line of talent, I should say; orderly, regular
habits; a very kind heart; I can't see any
events in particular; you've led a very quiet
life, I should say; fond of reading; I shouldn't
say you'd met many people or travelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
much"&mdash;she scrutinized the hand more
closely&mdash;"you'll probably develop a strong
religious feeling&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped and smiled deprecatingly. "It
is really impossible to say very much," she
said, "just now. It's what we call an immature
hand!"</p>

<p>For months after that Martha woke in the
night and tried to forget the nightmare of a
terrible figure that led her to an amphitheatre
of grinning enemies, and leered at her: <i>It's
what we call an Immature Hand!</i> She could
have suppressed the others, but the Sutton
twins were beyond earthly and human suppression.
It seemed to her that she never met
them or passed them in a corridor without
hearing their jovial assurance: "Oh, Martha
Williams is all right! Why, the idea! She's
as kind a girl as ever lived&mdash;she's nothing
like that story. Gracious, no! She's never
been to Paris&mdash;she lives in Portland. Why,
her father's a Sunday School Superintendent!
Oh, bother! She's as good as Alberta May,
every bit! She has a strong religious&mdash;" and
somebody passed on, assured&mdash;heavens, perhaps
admiring her character! At such times
Martha would read furiously in her French
novels or regard the skull pensively or sit up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
all night, which annoyed her room-mate and
the lady-in-charge. Her room-mate was an
absolutely unimportant person, and does not
come into the story at all.</p>

<p>It is now time to revert to the Twins.
When they appeared in the house, two solemn-eyed,
pigtailed imps from Buffalo, they
were packed away together in a double room
on the third floor, and except for their amazing
resemblance, were absolutely unnoted. The
matron uneasily fancied a certain undue disturbance
on the third floor, the evening of
their arrival, but on going to that level she
found all as still as the grave, and immediately
went back downstairs. It is only due to
her, however, to say that she never again
made such an error. From that time on any
abnormal quiet in the house was to her as the
trumpet to the war-horse; and she mounted
unerringly to the all-too-certain scene of action.
Their plans for the first year were rather
crude, though astonishingly effective at the
time. It was they who invented the paper bag
of water dropped from the fourth floor to
burst far below, and waken the house with
the most ghastly hollow explosion; it was
they who let a pair of scissors down two flights
to tap against the pane of an unfortunate enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
in the senior class, and send her into convulsions
of nervous and, as they said, guilty
fear. It was they who stuck new caramels to
their door-knob, and oblivious to the matron's
admonitions of the hour, waited till in
exasperation she seized the knob, when they
met her disgust with soap and apologies; it was
they who left the gas brightly burning and the
door temptingly ajar at 10.15, so that the long-suffering
woman pounced upon them with
just recrimination, only to find her stored-up
wrath directed against two night-gowned figures
bowed over their little white beds, as it
were two Infant Samuels. It is doubtful if a
devotional exercise ever before or since has
roused such mingled feelings in the bosom of
the chance spectator.</p>

<p>It was they who beyond a shadow of doubt
won the basket-ball game for the freshmen&mdash;an
unprecedented victory&mdash;by their marvellous
intuition of each other's intentions and
their manner of being everywhere at once and
playing into each other's hands with an uncanny
certainty. This gave them position and
weight among their mates, which they duly appreciated.
They were the recognized jesters of
the class, and their merry, homely faces were
sure of answering grins wherever they appeared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>When they returned sophomore year more
alike than ever, with happy plans for the best
double room on the second floor, they were
met by quite another kind of grin: its owner,
Mrs. Harrow, would have perhaps described
it as firm and pleasant&mdash;the Twins referred
to it bitterly as hypocritical and disgusting.</p>

<p>"No, Martha, no. It's no use to coax me&mdash;I
can't have it. I cannot go through another
such year. If you wish to remain in the
house, you must separate. You can have No. 10
with Alberta Bunting, and Kate can go in with
Margaret&mdash;she says she is perfectly willing,
rather than give up the room, and Helen is
not coming back till next year. Now, I don't
want to have to argue about it; I think you
are better apart."</p>

<p>No one ever accused Mrs. Harrow of tact.
Her placid firmness was almost the most exasperating
thing about her. Her decisions, if
apparently somewhat feather-beddish, ranked,
nevertheless, with those of the Medes and
Persians, and the Twins walked haughtily
away&mdash;beaten but defiant.</p>

<p>Of course it never occurred to them to leave
the house, and Kate, after a time, grew quite
contented, for Miss Pattison was eminently
pleasant and tactful, kept the room in beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
order, and spent a great deal of time in the
Dewey with her sister, an instructor in the college,
and her great friend Cornelia Burt, who
was off the campus. This left the room to the
Twins, who were almost as much together as
of yore. But Martha was in quite another case.
In her the insult of a dictated separation
rankled continually, and her hitherto mild
contempt for Mrs. Harrow deepened into a
positively appalling enmity. Circumstances
unfortunately assisted her feeling, for beyond
a doubt Alberta May Bunting was not adapted
to her new room-mate.</p>

<p>She was a wholesome, kindly creature, with
high principles and no particular waist-line.
She drank a great deal of milk, and was a
source of great relief to her teachers, her recitations
being practically perfect. From her
sophomore year she had been wildly, if solidly,
addicted to zoölogy, and to her, after
hours spent in the successful chase of the
doomed insect, the grasshopper was literally
a burden, for she slew him by the basketful.
She rendered the surrounding territory frogless
in her zeal for laboratory practice, and in
her senior year it was rumored that stray cats
fled at her approach: "She'll cut me up in
my sleep," said Martha, gloomily, "and soak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
me in formaline in the bath-tub&mdash;the idiot!"</p>

<p>For, although the "h'Arrow-that-flyeth-by-day-and-the-terror-that-walketh-by-night," as
Martha Williams, in a burst of inspiration,
had named her, could not, of course, have
known it, Sutton M., as she was most commonly
called, loathed and despised bugs, reptiles,
and crawling and dismembered things
generally, more than aught else beside. She
regarded an interest in such things as an indication
of mild insanity, and as a characteristic
of Alberta May's such a predilection assumed
the proportions of a malignant insult.</p>

<p>"It's bad enough to have her drink milk
like a cow, and eat graham crackers like a&mdash;like
a <i>steam-engine</i>," she confided to her sympathetic
sister, "and smell like a whole biological
laboratory, and glower at me, and bobble
her head like a China image whenever I
open my mouth, and call me Mottha, which
I despise, and say, 'Why, the <i>idea</i>! Why,
Mottha, the <i>idea</i>! What <i>do</i> you <i>mean</i>, Mottha?'
without putting little bottles of Things
all around, and my having to upset them.
My gym suit made me sick to put on for a
week because I upset some nasty little claws all
pickled in something per cent. alcohol on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
sleeve, and I kept thinking the legs were walking
on me&mdash;ugh! they were leggy claws!"</p>

<p>The h'Arrow-that-flyeth-by-day had fondly
hoped that Alberta would "do Martha Sutton
a world of good," because of her exemplary,
regular habits and her calm, sensible
nature, but this consummation, though devoutly
to be wished, was fated never to be
witnessed. Everyone heard the wails and gibes
of Sutton M., but to few or none were the
woes of Alberta May made known. But that
she must have had them, her attitude at the
time of the crisis conclusively proved.</p>

<p>The Twins, in the course of their mysterious
loitering, overheard a somewhat sentimental
discussion between Evelyn Lyon and
an extremely stiff and correct young man from
Amherst, as to whether chivalry and openly
expressed devotion to the fair were not disappearing
from the earth. "Men like shirt-waists
and golf-shoes," Evelyn had been heard
to murmur, with a glance at her fluffy chiffon
and bronze slippers, and the senior had protested
that they did not, and that emotion, if
controlled, was as deep as in the balcony-serenade
days. "In fact," said he, finally, "Estabrook
and I will serenade you Wednesday
night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"You would never dare," said Evelyn, with
a glance at his eye-glasses and collar, which
for height and circumference might have been
a cuff. "You'd be afraid the girls would
laugh." The senior looked nettled. "Expect
us at ten on Wednesday next," said he. "It
won't necessarily be the Glee and Banjo Club,
you understand, but it will be a real, old-fashioned
serenade." Then, as Evelyn smiled maliciously,
he added, "Only you must appear
at the casement, and throw flowers, you know&mdash;that's
what they did." Evelyn frowned, but
agreed. "At the end of the song, I will," she
said, with visions of the night-watchman hasting
to the scene.</p>

<p>The Twins were unaccountably strolling
about as the senior left the house, and wondered
with great distinctness and repetition
why on earth Evelyn should say she'd be in
14 at the front when of course she'd be in
the East corner on the first floor. "She has
some game up," shrieked Martha, and Kate
called back, "Of course she has&mdash;some one
will be awfully left, that's all!"</p>

<p>The senior listened, grinned, muttered that
women told everything they knew, and went
his way. On next Wednesday night, the entire
house being congregated in the hall near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
No. 14, where Evelyn, not to be found wanting
in case they <i>should</i> get through a verse, was
sorting carnations, a husky burst of song enlivened
the East corner, a mandolin and a
guitar having raced through a confused prelude
under the spur of a youth hopping with
nervousness and sputtering as he punched
the mandolin-player: "Hang it all, Pete, get
along, get along! He'll be here in a minute&mdash;whoop
it up, can't you?"</p>

<p>A muffled baritone began, standing so close
to the window with a light in it that its owner
could have touched the sill with his shoulder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Last night the nightingale waked me,</p>
<p>Last night when all was&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The shade went up, the window followed,
and the eyes of the musicians beheld, below
an audience of house-maids, the only people
at present on that side of the house, an enormous
woman, with gray hair in curling-kids,
and a blanket-wrapper which added to her
size, grasping a lamp in her hand and regarding
them with a mingling of amazement, irritation,
and authority that caused their blood
to curdle and their voices to cease. Pattering
feet, a lantern turned on them, and a voice:
"'Ere, 'ere, what you doing? H'all h'off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
campus after ten&mdash;get along, now!" completed
their confusion, and they left, with an
attempt at dignity and a slowness which they
had occasion to curse; for as they passed the
front of the house, from out of the air above
their heads, apparently, two sweet and boyish
voices, a first and second soprano, lifted up
to the fresh October sky an ancient and beautiful
hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Some<i>times</i> a <i>light</i> sur<i>pri</i>ses</p>
<p>The <i>Chris</i>tian <i>while</i> he <i>sings</i>,</p>
<p>It <i>is</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A window banged forcibly, and the minstrels
stood upon no order but fled to their
carriage and rattled out of town.</p>

<p>Evelyn Lyon, with set teeth and artistically
loosened hair, rushed down the hall behind
Martha Sutton, who made the room she was
aiming for, slammed the door, realized that the
key was lost, and dragged the first piece of furniture
that came to hand against it. This was
Alberta May's desk, and upon it were the collected
results of her vacation work at Wood's
Holl. Six jars upset under the impact of Evelyn's
weight, a dozen mounted cross-sections
jingled in the dark, a pint bottle of ink soaked
a thick and beautifully illustrated note-book;
and as the Terror-that-walketh-by-night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
headed Evelyn to her door and mounted a
flight to quell the rising tumult, Sutton M.,
with a hysterical sob, for she was tingling with
a delicious excitement, huddled the desk back
into the corner, hoped none of the bugs were
around the floor, and dropped into bed, wondering
how ever Alberta May could sleep
through such a night.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;though perhaps you may have
imagined that there was never going to be any
story&mdash;now we are coming to it, and though
it is short, all the characters appear. Alberta
May, with an ugly brick-red flush, told Sutton
M. that she need never speak to her again,
for no answer would be forthcoming, and that
she must have her things out of the room before
night. Martha was really horribly frightened,
and begged to be allowed to copy the
note-book and hire some one to make the
slides and re-pickle the scattered Things; but
Alberta May merely shook her head, replied
that she accepted apologies but could not speak
again, and kept her word, for she never noticed
Martha from then till the 22d of June.</p>

<p>The h'Arrow-that-flyeth-by-day gave Martha
an address that reduced her to a pulp, and
having sent the Twins off to cry in each other's
arms till dinner-time and got the doctor for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Evelyn, who had sprained her ankle in the
rush, she sat down to a cup of tea and council.</p>

<p>To her entered Biscuits, and they talked
of odds and ends till Mrs. Harrow had grown
a little calm. The girls in the house accused
Biscuits of a hypocritical and unnatural interest
in the h'Arrow: Biscuits denied this, alleging
that she was merely ordinarily courteous
and saw no occasion for treating her like a
dog, which somewhat strong language was
addressed with intention to a few of her friends
who certainly did not display any undue consideration
in their manner to the lady in question.
She was wont to add calmly that she saw
no sense in having those in authority hate you
when a little politeness would so easily prevent
it. And many times had she successfully
interceded for the offender and gained seats
for guests and obtained the parlor for dancing
purposes on nights not mentioned in the
bond. On these accounts she made an unusually
fine house president in her senior year, and
though as a sophomore she had been but suspiciously
regarded by that officer, she made
as firm a bond as is perhaps possible between
powers so hostile as those with which she
struggled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>To-day she listened sympathetically as Mrs.
Harrow held forth, concluding with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Bertha, something <i>must</i> be done. I
hate dreadfully to make a change, so early in
the year, too, but Alberta is decided, and says
that she will leave the house to-morrow unless
Martha leaves to-night. And Alberta is perfectly
justified: nobody could be expected to
put up with it. I don't know whom to put her
with: she certainly can't be trusted with her
friends, and I can't feel that I have any right
to put her anywhere else. I hate to have to
admit that I can't manage them&mdash;Miss Roberts
insists that they're fine girls and will outgrow
it all, and I have great respect for her
opinion, and yet&mdash;think of that disgraceful
performance last night! It would have done
credit to a boarding-school! I was so disgusted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and I've talked to them,
Mrs. Harrow, and told them just how the
house feels about it, but don't you think that it
was rather boarding-schoolish in Evelyn? She
started it all, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course. Evelyn shouldn't
have&mdash;but then she is a good, quiet girl, and&mdash;Oh,
not that I would excuse her!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Biscuits, briskly. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
was good management on her part, for Evelyn
had one friend in the house to the Twins' ten,
though a favorite with Mrs. Harrow.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Harrow, I've got an idea, and
truly, I think it would work," she added persuasively.
When she had unfolded the idea, the
lady-in-charge could hardly believe her ears.</p>

<p>"Why, Bertha Kitts, you must be crazy!
Nothing could induce me to think of it for
a moment&mdash;nothing! It would be the worst
possible influence!"</p>

<p>Biscuits argued gently. Her three years of
consistent good sense and politeness stood in
her favor, and though Mrs. Harrow had no
sense of humor whatever, she was enabled to
perceive a certain poetic justice in the plan set
before her.</p>

<p>"You know, Mrs. Harrow," she concluded,
"that at bottom they're both nice girls! They're
awfully irritating at times, and of course you
feel that they've both occasioned a great deal
of trouble; but they're both honorable, and
I'm sure it will be all right: truly, I'd be
willing to take the responsibility&mdash;if I can get
them to consent to it!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mrs. Harrow, unwillingly,
"you know them both better than I do, Bertha,
of course, and it certainly couldn't be any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
worse than it is! But at the first outbreak I
shall take the matter into my own hands, and
act very severely, if necessary!"</p>

<p>Biscuits went directly upstairs and sought
out Martha Williams, who lounged on the
couch with Loti in her hand and a bag of
chocolate peppermints in her lap. Her room-mate,
observing that Biscuits glanced at the
clock as she entered, murmured something
about getting a History note-book and obligingly
disappeared.</p>

<p>"That's a good harmless creature," observed
Biscuits, approvingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's in very good training," the
creature's room-mate returned. "Have a peppermint?"</p>

<p>"Pity <i>she</i> can't room with Alberta May,"
said Biscuits, lightly; "<i>she'd</i> give her no trouble!"</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" Martha agreed; "she wouldn't
trouble a fly!"</p>

<p>Biscuits wandered about the room and absent-mindedly
picked up a sheaf of papers.</p>

<p>"Themes back?" she inquired. Martha
nodded.</p>

<p>"'Me see 'em?" Martha shrugged her
shoulders in a manner to be envied of the
Continent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Biscuits opened at a poem that caught her
eye, and read it. Martha's eyes were apparently
fixed on <i>Madame Chrysanthème</i>, but they wandered
occasionally to Biscuits' face as she read.
The poem was called,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">THE LIFTING VEIL</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Do you love me now?</p>
<p>Ah, your mouth is cold!</p>
<p>Yet you taught me how&mdash;</p>
<p>Are we growing old?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Did you love me then?</p>
<p>Ah, your eyes are wet!</p>
<p>If the memory's sweet,</p>
<p>Why will you forget?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Could you love me still?</p>
<p>Hush! you shall not say!</p>
<p>Love is not of will&mdash;</p>
<p>Shall I go away?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Dare you love me now?</p>
<p>Let me burn my ships!</p>
<p>I, myself, am not so sure&mdash;</p>
<p>Am I worth your lips?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Um&mdash;ah&mdash;yes," said Biscuits, "sounds
something like Browning, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Martha looked only politely interested.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she said impersonally.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I like that line about the ships,"
added Biscuits, tentatively; "it&mdash;er&mdash;seems
to&mdash;er&mdash;<i>imply</i> so much!"</p>

<p>Martha looked enigmatically at the skull.
"Does it?" she asked.</p>

<p>Biscuits caught a glimpse of a long, hastily
written story, and gasped.</p>

<p>"Why, Martha, did you really hand <i>that</i>
in?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Certainly I did," said Martha; "why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it's really shocking, you know,"
Biscuits replied. "What <i>did</i> she say?"</p>

<p>Martha hesitated, but a twinkle slipped
into her eye and she smiled as she replied.
"Look and see," she said.</p>

<p>Biscuits turned to the last page, passing
many an underlined word or phrase by the
way, and read in crimson ink at the bottom:
<i>Mallock has done this better: you are getting
very careless in your use of relatives.</i> At which
Biscuits smiled wisely and reassured herself
of an announcement she had made in the middle
of her junior year to the effect that even
among the Faculty one ran across occasional
evidences of real intelligence.</p>

<p>"Martha," she said abruptly, "I meant
what I said about Mary and Alberta&mdash;they'd
make a very good pair."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"And Miss Sutton and I&mdash;" returned
Martha, sardonically.</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Biscuits, "Miss Sutton
and you. Oh, I know nobody has the slightest
right to ask it of you and we all supposed
you wouldn't, but at the same time I thought
I'd just lay it before you. I firmly believe,
Martha, that you are the only person in this
house capable of managing Martha Sutton!"</p>

<p>"I?" And <i>Madame Chrysanthème</i> dropped
to the floor.</p>

<p>"Yes, you. Now, Martha, just look at it:
you know that the girl is a perfect child&mdash;you
know that she means well enough, and in her
way she has a keen sense of humor. Now you
are much more mature than the average girl
up here and you take&mdash;er&mdash;broader views
of things than most of them. You wouldn't
be so shocked at the things Suttie does; you
could, very gradually, you know, convey to
her that her ideas of humor were just a little
crude, you know, and that would strike her
far more than the lectures that Alberta used
to read her by the hour."</p>

<p>"Oh! Alberta!" Martha gasped. "Alberta
was enough to drive <i>anybody</i> to drink!"</p>

<p>"Just so. Well, as I told Mrs. Harrow,
you were the one, but of course no one had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the least right to press it. And of course, in
your last year, and all that, and naturally you
haven't any special interest in her, and it's
all right if you won't."</p>

<p>Martha scowled for a moment and appeared
to be reviewing her own past life, rapidly and
impartially.</p>

<p>"It would be a good thing to have her kept
out of the halls, at least," she announced, at
last, irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"That's what I told Mrs. Harrow," said
Biscuits, eagerly. "You see, Alberta <i>bored</i> her
so, Martha. She's a clever child and she likes
clever people. She needs tact, and Alberta
hasn't the tact of a hen. Only, you see, Mrs.
Harrow felt that in a great many ways the
example&mdash;"</p>

<p>Martha rose and confronted her guest. "I
hope you understand, Biscuits, that if I ever
<i>did</i> go into the kindergarten business I should
know how to conduct myself properly. I have
never for one moment tried to fit everybody
to my own standards: I appreciate perfectly
that things are&mdash;er&mdash;relative, and that what
may be perfectly safe for me is not necessarily
so for others."</p>

<p>Biscuits coughed and said that she had always
known that, and it was for just that reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
that she had hesitated to ask Martha to
give up her ways and habits: habits which if
harmless to the unprejudiced observer were a
trifle irregular, viewed from the strictest standpoint
of a college house.</p>

<p>"There's no particular reason why you
should," she concluded, "and perhaps, anyhow,
as Mrs. Harrow says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps what?" snapped Martha.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing! Only she doesn't believe
you could do it, and of course she perfectly
loathes having to make a change this way&mdash;she
says it's a terrible precedent&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here, Biscuits," said Martha, solemnly,
"never mind about my habits. I suppose,"
magnificently, "it won't hurt me to get to bed
at ten, once in a way, and it's only till June,
anyhow. She <i>is</i> a bright enough child, and as
you say, she needs tact. If it keeps the house
quiet and saves you dinging at 'em all the time,
I can do it, I suppose. I might try studying for
a change before mid-years, too."</p>

<p>Biscuits got up to go. "I appreciate this
very much, Martha," she said gravely. "I
know what it means to you, but I really
think you'll do her a lot of good&mdash;I mean,"
at a sudden pucker of Martha's brows, "I
mean, of course, that a person to whom her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
badness doesn't seem so very terrible will be
a revelation to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Martha.</p>

<p>Biscuits waylaid Sutton M. on the stairs
after dinner and suggested a conversation in
her own cosey little single room. Sutton M.
accompanied her, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you think you're going to
do?" she inquired bitterly, as Biscuits offered
a shiny apple and tipped <i>Henry Esmond</i> off
the Morris chair. "Going to put me with
some spook or other, I suppose&mdash;I'll leave
the house first. I've had enough of that!"</p>

<p>"No, you won't, either," Biscuits replied.
"You'll be as good as Kate is, and not make
me curse the day I was elected house president.
Now, Suttie, I'm going to tell you something
that must not go beyond this room&mdash;beyond
this room," she repeated impressively.</p>

<p>"Not Kate? I have to tell Kate," said Sutton
M., but with an air of deepest interest.
Outsiders rarely confided in the Twins.</p>

<p>"Well, Kate then, but nobody else. Promise?"</p>

<p>Sutton M. nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do what might be greatly
criticised, Suttie, I'm going to tell you that
I think it would be a very good thing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Martha Williams if you would quietly go in
and room with her and let Mary come in with
Alberta. Now, I've done no beating about the
bush&mdash;I've told you out straight and plain.
What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say it's a fool arrangement, and that I
won't have a thing to do with it," said Sutton
M., promptly.</p>

<p>"All right," returned Biscuits, calmly,
"that's all. Is that apple green? I don't
mind it, but it makes some people sick."</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well Martha's the last
girl in the world&mdash;we'd fight night and day."</p>

<p>"I know she's one of the brightest girls in
the college, and that she's getting low in her
work, and it's a shame, too," said Biscuits.</p>

<p>"Would I make her higher?"</p>

<p>Sutton M. tried to be sarcastic, but she
showed in her manner the effect of the confidence.</p>

<p>"Yes, you would," said Biscuits. "Mary
Winter's just spoiling her. She's a perfect nonentity,
and she studies like a grammar-school
girl&mdash;it just disgusts Martha. And Mary admires
her so that Martha just rides over her
and gets to despise good regular studying because
Mary does it so childishly. If some one
could be with her who was bright and jolly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and liked fun and had a sense of humor and
did good work, too, for you two do study
well&mdash;I'll give you that credit&mdash;it would be
the making of her. And Mary's such an idiot.
She shows that Martha shocks her so much
that Martha just keeps it up to horrify her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Sutton M., wisely, "like
those cigarettes&mdash;Martha never really liked
them."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Biscuits agreed, though with an
effort, for the Twins certainly knew far too
much. "The moment I told Martha that it
wasn't in the least a question of morals with
us but entirely a matter of good taste&mdash;that
we didn't think she was wicked at all but that
it was very bad for the house, and that when
we were all represented in the <i>Police Gazette</i>
as trotting over the campus with cigarettes in
our mouths, the college would get all the credit
and she wouldn't get any&mdash;why, she stopped
right away. And considering how it irritated her
I think she was very nice and sensible about
it."</p>

<p>"But just because Kate and I studied, Martha
wouldn't, would she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she would. She'd feel that
it was an example to you if she didn't. And
she's so bright. It's a shame she should flunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
as she does. She knows we all know she could
get any marks she chose, so she doesn't care."</p>

<p>Sutton M. looked thoughtful. "I think
her stories are fine," she remarked. "And I
suppose I'd have to go with some spook, if
I don't," she added gloomily.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harrow feels bad enough about the
change," Biscuits interposed, "and she said
she'd act very severely next time. I persuaded
her that you'd&mdash;that is, I didn't persuade
her, I'm afraid. Of course, she feels that if you
<i>should</i> by any chance drag Martha into your
kiddish nonsense, why&mdash;she doesn't like
Martha any too well, you know, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Biscuits," interrupted Sutton M., hastily,
"if I <i>should</i> go in with Martha, and I must
say I should think <i>anybody'd</i> be welcome to
her after that stick of a Mary Winter, I
wouldn't drag her into a thing&mdash;truly, I
wouldn't. I'd be careful! Kate says that
Patsy says she's lots of fun and awfully jolly
and nice when you know her," she added.</p>

<p>Biscuits assented warmly. "And you understand,
Suttie," she continued, "that it's
not everybody I'd speak to in this way or
that Martha would have. Martha's rather particular:
she understands that Alberta May is
a little trying, good and kind as she is. But I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
realize what a good thing it would be for Martha
to be with somebody who wouldn't be so
shocked whenever she said anything to that
skull."</p>

<p>"Oh, that skull!" said Sutton M., with a
wave of her brown hand. She looked up and
caught Biscuits' eye with the sharp, uncompromisingly
literal Sutton twinkle. "Biscuits,"
she demanded, "did anybody ever know of
anything really <i>bad</i> that Martha ever did&mdash;ever?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Biscuits, promptly.</p>

<p>Sutton M. chuckled: "That's what we always
thought," she said, and added: "Well,
I'll try it, and," very solemnly, "you can trust
me, Biscuits&mdash;I promise you."</p>

<p>When Biscuits went back to Martha's room
she missed the skull, and beheld on the newly
dusted bookshelves a decorous row of historical
works and an assortment of German classics.
This gratified her, for it was with the German
department that Martha's erratic methods
of study most obviously clashed. Martha was
detaching from the wall a pleasing engraving
representing a long white lady with her head
hanging off from a couch, on which she somewhat
obtrusively reclined, an unwholesome demon
perching upon her chest and a ghastly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
white horse peeping at her between gloomy
curtains. This cheerful effect was entitled
"The Nightmare," and as it left the wall,
Martha fell upon an enlargement in colored
chalk of one of Mr. Beardsley's most vivid
conceptions, and laid them away together.</p>

<p>"Why, Martha!" she exclaimed, "this is
really too much&mdash;there's no reason why you
should take your things down!"</p>

<p>Martha smiled tolerantly. "Oh, it makes
no matter to me," she said indifferently. "I
know the Loti by heart, anyhow, and though
none of these things affect me in the slightest
way&mdash;I really can't see anything in them one
way or the other&mdash;still I frankly refuse to take
any responsibility. If the child should happen
to feel that the skull, for instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>Biscuits grinned. "It's one less thing to
dust, anyway," she remarked, and left Martha
to her work of reconstruction.</p>

<p>She wandered in, one evening, two or three
weeks later, to get a German dictionary, and
beheld with a pardonable pride the Twins
gabbling their irregular verbs in whispers by
the lamp, while Martha, stretched on the couch
beneath the gas, communed with Schiller and
the dictionary. The Twins gave her one swift
ineffable glance, kicked each other under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
table, and bent their eyes upon their grammars:
Martha nodded to her, indicated the
Twins with one of her three-volume smiles,
and drawled as she handed her the dictionary,
"In the words of Mr. Dooley and the Cubans,
'Pa-pa has lost his job, and all is now
happiness and a cottage-organ'!"

<span class="smcap">From Miss Elizabeth Stockton</span><br />
<span class="smcap">to Miss Carolyn Sawyer</span></p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Lowell, Mass., Sept. 10, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carol</span>: The thing we
have both wished so much has
happened! Papa has finally consented
to let me go to college! It
has taken a long time and a <i>great deal</i> of persuasion,
and Mamma never cared <i>anything</i> about it,
you know, herself. But I laid it before her in a
way that I really am ashamed of! I never thought
I'd do anything like it! But I <i>had</i> to, it seemed
to me. I told her that she had often spoken of
what a mistake Mrs. Hall made in letting Marjory
come out so soon, and that I should <i>certainly</i>
be unwilling to stay at Mrs. Meade's another
year. I'm doing advanced work now, and
I'm <i>terribly</i> bored. The girls all seem so very
young, somehow! And I said that I couldn't
come out till I was twenty-two, if I went to
college. I teased so that she gave way, but we
had a <i>terrible</i> siege with Papa. He is the <i>dearest</i>
man in the world, but just a little <i>tiny</i>
bit prejudiced, you know. He wants me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
finish at Mrs. Meade's and then go abroad for
a year or two. He wants me to do something
with my music. But I told him of the <i>fine</i> Music
School there was at Smith, and how much
<i>harder</i> I should work there, <i>naturally</i>. He
talked a good deal about the art advantages
and travel and French&mdash;you know what I
think about the <i>terrible narrowness</i> of a boarding-school
education! It is <i>shameful</i>, that an
intellectual girl of this century should be tied
down to <i>French</i> and <i>Music</i>! And how can the
scrappy little bit of gallery sight-seeing that
I should do <i>possibly</i> equal four years of earnest,
intelligent, <i>regular</i> college work? He
said something about marriage&mdash;oh, dear! It
is <i>horrible</i> that one should have to think of
that! I told him, with a great deal of dignity
and rather coldly, I'm afraid, that <i>my</i> life
would be, I hoped, <i>something more</i> than the mere
<i>evanescent glitter</i> of a <i>social butterfly</i>! I think
it really impressed him. He said, "Oh, very
well&mdash;very well!" So I'm coming, dearest,
and you must write me all about what books
I'd better get and just what I'd better know
of the college customs. I'm <i>so</i> glad you're on
the campus. You know Uncle Wendell knows
the President very well indeed&mdash;he was in
college with him&mdash;and, somehow or other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
I've got a room in the Lawrence, though
we didn't expect it so soon! I feel inspired
already when I think of the chapel and the big
Science Building and that <i>beautiful</i> library!
I've laid out a course of work that Miss Beverly&mdash;that's
the literature teacher&mdash;thinks
very ambitious, but I am afraid she doesn't
realize the intention of a <i>college</i>, which is a
little different, I suppose, from a <i>boarding-school</i>(!)
I have planned to take sixteen hours
for the four years. I must say I think it's
rather absurd to limit a girl to that who <i>really</i>
is <i>perfectly</i> able to do more. Perhaps you could
see the Register&mdash;if that's what it is&mdash;and
tell him I could just as well take eighteen, and
then I could do that other Literature. I must
go to try on something&mdash;really, it's very hard
to convince Mamma that Smith isn't a <i>summer
resort</i>! Good-by, dearest, we shall have
such <i>beautiful</i> times together&mdash;I'm sure you'll
be as excited as I am. We shall <i>for once</i> see
as much of each other as we want to&mdash;I wish
I could study with you! I'm coming up on
the 8.20 Wednesday morning.</p>

<p class="left45"><i>Lake Forest, Ill., Sept. 17, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bess</span>: I'm very glad you're coming
up&mdash;it's the only place in the world. I'm
not going to be able to meet you&mdash;I'm coming
back late this year&mdash;Mrs. Harte is going
to give our crowd a house-party at Lakemere.
Isn't that gay? I met Arnold Ritch this
summer. He knows you, he said. I never heard
you speak of him. He's perfectly <i>smooth</i>&mdash;his
tennis is all right, too. For heaven's sake, don't
try to take sixteen hours&mdash;on the campus,
too! It will break you all up. You'll get on
the Glee Club, probably&mdash;bring up your
songs, by the way&mdash;and you'll want to be on
the Team. Have you got that blue organdie?
You'll want something about like that, pretty
soon. If you can help it, don't get one of those
Bagdad things for your couch. I'm deadly
sick of mine. Get that portière thing you used
to have on the big chair at home. It's more
individual. We're getting up a little dance for
the 26th. If you know any man you could
have up, you can come&mdash;it will be a good
chance to meet some of the upper-class girls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
We may not be able to have it, though. Don't
tell Kate Saunders about this, please. She'd
ask Lockwood over from Amherst, and I've
promised Jessie Holden to ask him for her.
We shall probably have Sue for class president
this year&mdash;I'm glad of it, too. There
will be a decent set of ushers. I suppose you'll
want me for your senior for the sophomore-senior
thing. I'll keep that if you wish. I shall
get up by the 24th. I'm in the Morris. Don't
forget your songs.</p>

<span class="smcap">From Mrs. Henry Stockton</span><br />
<span class="smcap">to Mrs. John Sawyer</span></p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Lowell, Mass., Sept. 23, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ella</span>: In spite of great uncertainty
on my part and actual unwillingness on her
father's, Lizzie has started for Smith. It seems
a large undertaking, for four years, and I must
say I would rather have left her at Mrs.
Meade's. But her heart is set on it, and it is
very hard to deny her. She argues so, too;
really, the child has great ability, I think.
She fairly convinced me. It has always seemed
to me that a girl with good social surroundings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
a good home library, and an intellectual
home atmosphere does very well with four
years at so good a school as Mrs. Meade's,
and a little travel afterwards. Lizzie has quite
a little musical talent, too, and I should have
liked her to devote more attention to that.
Very frankly, I cannot say that I have been
able to see any improvement in Carrie since
she went away. I suppose it will wear off, but
when I saw her this summer she had a manner
that I did not like so well as her very pleasant
air three&mdash;no, two&mdash;years ago. It seemed
a curious mixture of youth and decision, that
had, however, no maturity in it. Katharine
Saunders, too, seems to me so utterly irresponsible
for a young woman of twenty-one,
and yet so almost arrogant. I expected she
would know a great deal, as she studied Greek
before she went, but she told me that she always
skipped the Latin and Greek quotations
in books! She seems to be studying nothing
but French and Literature and History; her
father could perfectly well have taught her all
that, and was anxious to, but she would hear
nothing of it. She wanted the college life, she
said. Ah, well, I suppose the world has moved
on since we read Livy at Miss Hopkins'! I
picked up a Virgil of Lizzie's yesterday and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
was astonished to find how it all came back.
We felt very learned, then, but now it is nothing.</p>

<p>I hope Carrie will be good to my little girl
and help her perhaps with her lessons&mdash;not
that I fear Lizzie will need very much help!
Miss Beverly assures me that she has never
trained a finer mind. Her essay on Jane Austen
was highly praised by Dr. Strong, the rector
of St. Mary's. Of course, dear Ella, you won't
resent my criticism of Carrie&mdash;I should never
dream of it with any one but an old and valued
friend, and I shall gladly receive the same from
you. But Lizzie has always been all that I
could wish her.</p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Boston, Mass., Oct. 16, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Niece</span>: Your mother advises me
of your having just entered Smith Academy.
I had imagined that your previous schooling
would have been sufficient, but doubtless your
parents know best. Your mother seems a little
alarmed as to your success, but I have reassured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
her. I trust the Stockton blood. Whatever
your surroundings may be, you can never,
I am sure, set yourself a higher model than
your mother. I have never known her to lack
the right word or action under any circumstances,
and if you can learn that in your
schooling, your friends and relatives will be
more than satisfied.</p>

<p>I enclose my cheque for fifty dollars ($50),
in case you should have any special demand on
your purse not met by your regular allowance.
I remember many such in my own schooldays.
Wishing you success in your new life, I remain,</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate uncle,<br />

<span class="smcap">From Miss Elizabeth Craigie</span><br />
<span class="smcap">to Miss Elizabeth Stockton</span></p>

<p class="left45"><i>New Haven, Conn., Oct. 21, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Elizabeth</span>: Sarah tells me that
you are going to college. I am sure I don't see
why, but if you do, I suppose that is enough.
Children are not what they used to be. It
seems to me that four years at Mrs. Meade's
should have been enough; neither your Aunt
Hannah nor I ever went to college, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
to be sure Hannah wanted to go to Mt. Holyoke
Seminary once. I have never heard any
one intimate that either of us was not sufficiently
educated: I wonder that you could for
one instant imagine such a thing! Not that I
have any reason to suppose you ever did.
However, that is neither here nor there. Your
Aunt Hannah and I were intending to give
you Mother's high shell-comb and her garnet
set for Christmas. If you would prefer them
now for any reason, you may have them. The
comb is being polished and looks magnificent.
An absurd thing to give a girl of your age,
from my point of view. However, your Aunt
Hannah thinks it best. I trust you will be very
careful of your diet. It seemed to me that
your complexion was not what it should have
been when you came on this summer. I am
convinced that it is nothing but the miscellaneous
eating of cake and other sweets and
over-education. There has been a young girl
here from some college&mdash;I think it is Wellesley&mdash;and
her complexion is disgraceful. Your
Aunt Hannah and I never set up for beauties,
but we had complexions of milk and roses, if
I do say it. Hannah thinks that the garnets
are unsuitable for you, but that is absurd.
Mother was no older than you when she wore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
them, and looked very well, too, I have no
doubt. I send you by express a box of Katy's
doughnuts, the kind you like, very rich, and
a chocolate cake. Also some salad and a loaf
cake, Mrs. Harding's rule. I trust you will
take sufficient exercise, and don't let your
hands grow rough this winter. Nothing shows
a lady so much as her hands. Would you like
the garnets reset, or as Mother wore them?
They are quite the style now, I understand.
Hoping you will do well in your studies and
keep well, I am,</p>

<p class="left45">

<span class="smcap">From Miss Elizabeth Stockton</span><br />
<span class="smcap">to Mr. Arnold Ritch, Jr.</span></p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Lawrence House, Northampton, Mass.,
Nov. 1, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Arnold</span>: It is only fair to you
to tell you that it can never be. No, never!
When I&mdash;if I did (which I can hardly believe)&mdash;allowed
you to think anything else,
I was a mere child. Life looks very different
to me, now. It is quite useless to ask me&mdash;I
must say that I am surprised that you have
spoken to Papa. Nor do I feel called upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
to give my reasons. I shall always be a very,
very good friend to you, however, and very,
very much interested in you.</p>

<p>In the first place, I am, or at least you are,
far too young. The American woman of to-day
is younger than her grandmother. I mean,
of course, younger than her grandmother is
now. That is, than she was then. Also I doubt
if I could ever love you as you think you do.
Love me, I mean. I am not a man's woman.
I much prefer women. Really, Arnold, it is
very strange how men bore me now that I
have known certain women. Women are so
much more interesting, so much more fascinating,
so much more exciting! This will probably
seem strange to you, but the modern
woman I am sure is rapidly getting not to need
men at all! I have never seen so many beautiful
red-haired girls before. One sits in front
of me in chapel, and the light makes an aureole
of glory about her head. I wrote a theme
about it that is going to be in the <i>Monthly</i> for
November.</p>

<p>I hope that you won't feel that our dear
old friendship of so many years is in any way
changed. I shall never forget certain things&mdash;</p>

<p>I am enjoying my work very much, though
it is easier than I had thought it would be, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the life is different in many ways. If I did not
think that Miss Sawyer had probably invited
you, I should be very glad to have you come
up for the Christmas concert, but I suppose it
is useless to ask you. I had no idea you were
so fond of tennis!</p>

<p class="left45">
Your friend always,<br />
<span class="smcap left25">Elizabeth Wolfe Stockton</span>.</p>

<p class="center p2">VII<br />
<span class="smcap">From Mr. Henry Stockton</span><br />
<span class="smcap">to Miss Elizabeth Stockton</span></p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Lowell, Mass., Nov. 1, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Elizabeth</span>: Yours received and
read with my usual attention and interest.
I am glad that your college life continues to
be pleasant, and that you have found so many
friends. I was much interested, too, in the photograph
of Miss Hunter. I find the blue prints
are more common than I had supposed, for I
had imagined that they were something quite
new. It is certainly very accommodating in
your teachers to allow themselves to be so
generally photographed. Your mother seemed
much pleased with Miss Hunter, and glad that
you were in the house with her and liked her
so much. I was surprised to see her so young
in appearance. I had very foolishly imagined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the typical old style "school-marm," I suppose.
But it seems that she was graduated only
a few years ago, herself.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Elizabeth, I am going to
speak to you very seriously. I trust that you
will take it in good part and remember that
nothing can be more to my interest than the
real happiness and well-being of my daughter.
The tone of your letters to both your mother
and me has seemed for some weeks unsatisfactory.
I mean that we have found in them
a nervous, strained tone that troubles me exceedingly.
I cannot see why you should close
with such expressions as this (I copy verbatim):
"Too tired to write more;" "All used
up&mdash;lots of Latin to do&mdash;can only find time
for a note;" "Tired to death because I'm not
sleeping quite as well as usual, just now;" et
cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>I have been to see Mrs. Meade, and she
assures me that your preparation was more
than adequate: that your first year should
prove very easy for you, <i>in Latin especially</i>.
Now what does this mean? You left us well
and strong, considering that you have always
been a delicate girl. It was for that reason, as
you know, that I particularly opposed your
going to college.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>But there is more. Mrs. Allen's daughter,
Harriet, has been at home for some days to
attend her sister's wedding. Your mother and
I naturally seized the opportunity of inquiring
after you, and after some questioning from
us she admitted that you were not looking very
well. She said that you seemed tired and were
"going it a little too hard, perhaps." That
seemed to me a remarkable expression to apply
to a young girl! My endeavors to find out
exactly what it meant resulted in nothing more
explicit than that "Bess was trying to do too
much."</p>

<p>Now, my dear girl, while we are naturally
only too pleased that you should be striving
to stand well in your classes, do not, I beg of
you, imagine for one moment that any intellectual
advancement you may win can compensate
us or you for the loss of your health. You
remember Cousin Will, who carried off six honors
at Harvard and came home a nervous invalid.
I fear that the Stockton temperament
cannot stand the strain of too continued mental
application.</p>

<p>I must stop now, to attend to some business
matters, and I will add only this. Do not
fail to remember my definite conditions, which
have not altered since September. If you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
not perfectly well at the Christmas holidays,
you must remain with us. This may seem severe,
but I am convinced, your mother also,
that we shall be acting entirely for your good.</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours aff.,<br />
<span class="smcap left25">Father</span>.</p>

<p class="center p2">VIII<br />
<span class="smcap">From Mr. Arnold Ritch, Sr.,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">to Miss Marion Hunter</span></p>

<p class="left45">
<i>New York, N. Y., Nov. 4, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Miss Hunter</span>: You may remember
meeting, five years ago, in Paris, in the
Louvre, an old American, who had the great
pleasure of rendering you a trifling assistance
in a somewhat embarrassing situation, and who
had the further pleasure of crossing on the
<i>Etruria</i> with you a month later. I was that
man, and I remember that you said that if
ever there should happen to be an occasion
for it, you would be only too happy to return
your imaginary debt.</p>

<p>If you really meant it, the occasion, strangely
enough, has come. I know well enough from my
lifelong friend, Richard Benton, whose family
you have so often visited, that you are an extremely
busy young woman, and I will state
my case briefly. I never make half-confidences,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and I rely implicitly on your discretion in the
following clear statement. My only nephew
and namesake, incidentally heir, has been for
some time practically engaged to Miss Elizabeth
Stockton, the daughter of an old friend.
The engagement has been entirely satisfactory
to all parties concerned, and was actually on
the eve of announcement, when the young lady
abruptly departed for Smith College.</p>

<p>My nephew is, though only twenty-four,
unusually mature and thoroughly settled: he
was deeply in love with the young lady and
assures me that his sentiments were returned.
She now quietly refuses him, and greatly to
her parents' dissatisfaction announces that she
intends remaining the four years and "graduating
with her class," which seems a strong
point with her.</p>

<p>Her father and I would gladly leave the
affair to work itself out quietly, were it not
for an unfortunate occurrence. Ritch, Jr. has
been offered an extremely good opening in a
Paris banking-house, which he must accept, if
at all, immediately, and for six years. He is
extremely broken up over the whole affair,
and says that unless Elizabeth returns to her
old relations with him, he will go. This will
be in three weeks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>I am not so young as I was, and I cannot
leave America again. I can only say that if the
boy goes, my interest in life goes, to a great
extent, with him. He does not mean to be
selfish, but young people, you know, are
harder than they think, and feel deeply and,
for the moment, irrevocably. He says that he
is certain that this is merely a fad on Miss
Stockton's part, and that if he could see her
for two weeks he would prove it. I should like
to have him try.</p>

<p>This is my favor, Miss Hunter. Elizabeth
respects and admires you more than any of her
teachers. She quotes you frequently and seems
influenced by you. Arnold has made me promise
that I will not ask her parents to bring her
home and that I will not write her. I will not.
But can you do anything? It is rather absurd
to ask you to conspire against your college,
to give up one of your pupils: but you have
a great many, and remember that I have but
one nephew! It is all rather a comedy, but a
sad one for me, if there is no change within
three weeks, I assure you. They are only two
headstrong children, but they can cause more
than one heartache if they keep up their obstinacy.
Elizabeth has forbidden Arnold to
come to Northampton on the score of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
work, and wild horses could not drag him
there.</p>

<p>I offer no suggestion, I ask nothing definitely,
I merely wonder if you meant what you
said on the <i>Etruria</i>, and if your woman's wit,
that must have managed so many young idiots,
can manage these?</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap left25">Arnold M. Ritch</span>.</p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Northampton, Mass., Nov. 7, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Stockton</span>: As you have
certainly not forgotten that I assured you in
the early fall of my interest, professionally and
personally, in your daughter, you will need no
further explanation, nor be at all alarmed,
when I tell you that Elizabeth is a little over-worked
of late. In the house with her as I am,
I see that she is trying to carry a little too
much of our unfortunately famous "social
life" in connection with her studies, where she
is unwilling to lose a high grade. She entered
so well prepared that she has nothing to fear
from a short absence, and as she tells me that
she does not sleep well at all of late, she will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
have no difficulty in getting an honorable furlough.
Two weeks or so of rest and freedom
from strain will set her up perfectly, I have no
doubt, and she can return with perfect safety to
her work, which is, I repeat, quite satisfactory.</p>

<i>Northampton, Mass., Nov. 10, 189-.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Con</span>: I'm afraid it will be impossible
for me to accept your seductive invitation
for Thanksgiving. We're pulling the girls up
a little sharply this year, and it would hardly
do for me to come back late. But it <i>would</i> be
good to hear a little music once more!</p>

<p>It was rather odd that you should have mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
that idiotic affair of mine in Paris&mdash;the
hero of it has just written me a long letter
<i>apropos</i> of his nephew, who wants to marry
that little Miss Stockton, whose Harvard
cousin you knew so well. That portly squire
of dames is actually simple and straightforward
enough to suggest that I precipitate the
damsel into the expectant arms of his nephew
and heir-apparent&mdash;he is used to getting his
own way, certainly, and he writes a rather attractive
letter. I owe him much (as you know)
and if Elizabeth, who is a dear little thing and
far too nice for the crowd she's getting in
with&mdash;you knew Carol Sawyer, didn't you?&mdash;has
such a weak-kneed interest in college
as to be turned out of the way by a sight of
the destined young gentleman, I fancy she
would not have remained long with us in any
case. She's a pretty creature and had cunning
ways&mdash;I shall miss her in the house. For I
don't believe she'll come back; she's not at
all strong, and her parents are much worried
about her health. It is more than probable
that the Home will prove her sphere.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't mind stating that I
would it were mine. When I consider how my
days are spent&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>You might not believe it, but they grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
stupider and stupider. Perhaps I've been at
it a bit too long, but I never saw such papers
as these freshmen give one.</p>

<p>And they have begun singing four hymns
in succession on Sunday morning! It's very
hard&mdash;why they should select <i>Abide with Me</i>
and <i>Lead, Kindly Light</i> for morning exercises
and wail them both through to the bitter end
every Sunday in the year is one of the local
mysteries.</p>

<p>I must get at my papers, they cover everything.
Remember me to Mr. Jackson; it was
very kind of him to suggest it, but I must
wait till Christmas for the Opera, I'm afraid.
If I should not come back next year&mdash;and it
is more than possible that I shan't&mdash;I may
be in Boston. I hope in that case you won't
have gone away.</p>

<span class="smcap">From Miss Elizabeth Stockton</span><br />
<span class="smcap">to Miss Carolyn Sawyer</span></p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Lowell, Nov. 20.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carol dear</span>: I am writing in a great hurry,
as I have an engagement at four, to tell you
that I have decided not to return to-day, as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
intended. Will you get the key of 32 from
Mrs. Driscoll, as Kitty goes home over Sunday,
so it will be locked, and get out my mink
collarette and my silver toilet things and my
blanket wrapper, and I think there is twenty
dollars in my handkerchief case. I am extremely
disturbed and confused&mdash;when one
is really responsible for anything one feels
very much disturbed. Of course, I don't believe
a word of it&mdash;it's all folly and nonsense&mdash;but
still, six years is a long time. Of course,
you don't know at all what I mean, dear, and
I'm not sure I do either. I forgot to say that
I'm probably not coming back to college this
year. Mamma feels very worried about my
health&mdash;you know I didn't sleep very well
nights, and I used to dream about Livy. Anyway,
she and Papa are going abroad early in
the spring, and really, Carol, a college education
isn't everything. If I were going to
teach, you know, it would be different, but
you see I was almost finished at Mrs. Meade's&mdash;I
was taking advanced work&mdash;and it isn't
as if I had had only the college preparation.
Then, if we go abroad, I must do something
with my French. You know there was simply
<i>no</i> chance to practise conversation in such a
large class, and I was forgetting it, which Arnold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
thinks would be a pity. He speaks very
fine French himself. Then, you see, there'll
be all the galleries and everything and the
Sistine Madonna and the cathedrals&mdash;they're
so educative&mdash;everybody admits that. It's
hardly to be supposed that Geometry and Livy
are really going to be as broadening to me as
a year of travel with Papa and Mamma, is it?
And though I never said anything to you
about it, I really have felt for some time that
there was something a little narrow about the
college. They seem to think it is about all
there is of life, you know, with the funny little
dances and the teas and all that. Even that
dear Miss Hunter is really <i>un peu gâtée</i> with
it all&mdash;she thinks, I believe, that a college
education is all there is for anybody. She told
Mamma that I wasn't well&mdash;she wanted me
to keep my high grade. Oh! Carol! there are
better things than grades! Life is a very much
bigger thing than the campus even! I think,
dear, that one really ought to consider very
frankly just what we intend to do with our
lives&mdash;if we are going to marry, we ought to
try to make ourselves cultivated and broad-minded,
and in every way worthy to be&mdash;Oh,
Carol, dearest, I'm terribly happy! It isn't
settled, of course: I am utterly amazed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
they all seem to think it is, but it isn't.
Only probably if I still feel as I do now,
when we get back, I shall ask you, dear, what
we promised each other&mdash;to be my bridesmaid&mdash;the
first one! I'm thinking of asking
Sally and Grace and Eleanor&mdash;all our old set
at Mrs. Meade's, you know. I think that
pink, with a deep rose for hats and sashes,
would look awfully well on all of you, don't
you! It seems a long time since I was in
Northampton: the girls seem very young and
terribly serious over queer little lessons&mdash;or
else trying to play they're interested in each
other. Arnold says he thinks the attitude of
so many women is bound to be unhealthy,
and even in some cases a little morbid. I think
he is quite right, don't you? After all, girls
need some one besides themselves. I always
thought that Mabel Towne was very bad for
Katharine. Will you send, too, my Shelley
and my selections from Keats? The way I
neglected my reading&mdash;real reading, you
know&mdash;oh! <i>c'était affreux!</i> I'm learning the
loveliest song&mdash;Arnold is very fond of it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Ninon, Ninon, que fais-tu de la vie?</i></p>
<p><i>L'heure s'enfuit, le jour succède au jour.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>I'm going out now for a walk. I'm sure
you'll like Arnold&mdash;I think you said you met
him. He doesn't remember you. Remember
me to all the juniors I met, and if you see
Ethel Henderson, tell her I'll write to her
when I get time. Excuse this pointed pen&mdash;I'm

<p class="stories">VI<br />

A FAMILY AFFAIR</p>

<p>There are Jacksons and Jacksons.
As everybody knows, many, possibly
most, of those who bear that title
might as well have been called Jones
or Robinson; on the other hand, I am told that
certain Massachusetts families of that name
will, on solicitation, admit it to be their belief
that Eve was a Cabot and Adam a Jackson.
Without asserting that she was personally convinced
of this great fact, it is necessary to state
that Susan was of the last-named variety of
Jackson. She was distinctly democratic, however,
and rather strong-willed, and for both of
these reasons she came to college. It did not
entirely please the family: neither of her sisters
had gone, and her brothers in particular
were against it. It is probable that she would
have been decoyed from her plan had it not
been that her cousin, Constance Quincy Jackson,
had been for a year one of the young
assistants who dash like meteors through the
catalogue and disappear mysteriously, just as
astronomers have begun to place them, into
the obscurity whence they came.</p>

<p>Constance, like Susan, had been persistent,
and was studying at Oxford before the family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
had quite made up its mind how to regard her;
later, she frequented other and American institutions
of learning and bore off formidable
degrees therefrom, and at about that time it
was decided that she was remarkably brilliant,
and that her much commended thesis on the
Essential Somethingness of Something or
Other was quite properly to be ranked with
her great-grandfather's dissertation on the Immortality
of the Soul.</p>

<p>She would do very well; she could be relied
on; and entrusted to her and further armed
with letters of introduction to the social magnates
of the vicinity&mdash;which, I regret to say,
she neglected to present till her sophomore
year&mdash;Susan began her career. Of the eminent
success of this career, it is not the purpose
of this story to treat. Beginning as freshman
vice-president, she immediately identified
herself with the leading set of her class, and
in her sophomore year was already one of
the prominent students in the college. She
was one of Phi Kappa's earliest acquisitions,
and belonged to three or four lesser societies,
social and semi-educational; she had been on
the freshman Team; she was twice a member
of the Council; in her senior year she was
literary editor of the <i>Monthly</i> and class president,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
besides taking a prominent part in Dramatics.
She fulfilled all these duties most acceptably,
taking at the same time a very high
rank in her classes: in one department, indeed,
her work was pronounced practically perfect
by a somewhat exigent professor. And in addition,
she was well born, well bred, and well
dressed, and considered by her most enthusiastic
admirers the handsomest girl in the
college, though this was by no means the
universal opinion.</p>

<p>You might imagine that Miss Jackson was
therefore intolerably conceited, but in this you
would err. She took no particular credit to
herself for her standard of work; she had a
keen mind, and had been taught to concentrate
it, and her grandfather, her father, and
two uncles had successively led their classes
at Harvard. It seemed perfectly natural to her
to be told that she was the one young woman
on whose shoulders a golf cape looked really
dignified and graceful&mdash;had not her grandmother
and her great-aunt been famed for their
"camel's-hair-shawl shoulders"? A somewhat
commanding manner and a very keen-sighted
social policy had given her a prominence that
she was conscious of having done nothing to
discredit; and as she had been quite accustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
to see those about her in positions
of authority, and had learned to lay just the
proper amount of emphasis on adverse criticism,
she steered her way with a signal success
on the perilous sea of popularity. Her idea of
the four years had been to do everything there
was to be done as well as any one could do it,
and she was not a person accustomed to consider
failure.</p>

<p>I mentioned at the beginning of this story
the two classes of Jacksons. Emphatically of
the former and unimportant variety was Elaine
Susan Jackson of Troy, New York. Mr. Jackson
kept a confectionery shop and ice cream
parlor, going to his business early in the morning
and returning late in the evening. This he
did because he was a quiet-loving man, and
his home was a noisy one. Mrs. Jackson was
a managing, dictatorial woman, with an unexpected
sentimental vein which she nourished
on love-stories and exhausted there.
From these books she had culled the names
of her daughters&mdash;Elaine, Veronica, and Doris;
but prudence impelled her to add to these the
names of her husband's three sisters&mdash;a triumph
of maternal foresight over æsthetic taste&mdash;and
they stood in the family Bible, Elaine
Susan, Veronica Sarah, and Doris Hannah.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was not a sentimentalist himself,
and read nothing but the paper, sitting
placidly behind the peanut-brittle and chocolate
mice, and relapsing sometimes into absolute
idleness for hours together, deep in
contemplation, perhaps, possibly dozing&mdash;nobody
ever knew. At such times he regarded
the entrance of customers as an unwelcome
intrusion and was accustomed to hurry them,
if juvenile, into undue precipitance of choice.
From this even quiet he emerged seldom but
effectively: when Veronica entertained the unattractive
young men she called "the boys,"
later than eleven o'clock, when Doris went
to the theatre more than twice a week, or when
they had purchased garments of a nature more
than usually unsuitable and pronounced. Then
Mr. Jackson spoke, and after domestic whirlwinds
and fires the still voice of an otherwise
doubtful head of the family became the voice
of authority.</p>

<p>Elaine gave him no trouble of this sort. She
did not care for young men, and she never
went to the theatre. Her clothes, when she
had any choice in the matter, were of the plainest,
and she had never teased her father for
candy since she began to read, which was at
a very early age. <i>I Say No, or the Love-letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Answered</i>, was her first consciously studied
book, and between ten and fifteen she devoured
more novels than most people get
into a lifetime. Incidentally she read poetry&mdash;she
got books of it for prizes at school&mdash;and
one afternoon she sandwiched the <i>Golden
Treasury</i> between two detective stories. She
did not care for her mother's friends, gossiping,
vulgar women, and she loathed her sisters'.
She had a sharp tongue, and as parental
discipline was of the slightest, she criticised
them all impartially with the result that she
was cordially disliked by everybody she knew&mdash;a
feeling she returned with interest. She
found two or three ardent friends at school
and was very happy with them for a time, but
she was terribly exacting, and demanded an allegiance
so intense and unquestioning that one
by one they drifted away into other groups and
left her.</p>

<p>In her second year at the high school they
read the <i>Idylls of the King</i>, and she discovered
her name and saw in one shame-filled second
the idiotic bad taste of it&mdash;Elaine Susan! She
imagined the lily maid of Astolat behind her
father's counter and became so abased in
her own mind that the school found her more
haughty and disagreeable than ever. From that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
moment she signed her name E. Susan Jackson
and requested to be called Susan. This
met the approval of the teachers, and as the
schoolgirls did not hold much conversation
with her, the change was not a difficult one.</p>

<p>By the time she had been three years in the
high school she was considered by every one
the most brilliant student there, and the principal
suggested college to her. This had never
occurred to her. Though they had never lacked
for necessities, Mr. Jackson's business was
not conducted in a manner to lead to marked
financial success, and though he said little
about his affairs, it was evident to them all
that matters were slowly but surely running
down hill. Doris and Veronica were eager to
leave school and spend a term at the Business
College, some friends of theirs having done
this with great success and found positions as
typewriters, but their father insisted on their
staying at school for two years at least. It would
be time enough to leave, he said, when they
had to. It was significant of the unconscious
attitude of the family that there had never
been any question of the oldest daughter's
leaving school: Elaine had always been real
bright, her mother said, and as long as books
was all she took any interest in, she might as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
well get what she could&mdash;she presumed she'd
teach.</p>

<p>But this acquiescent spirit changed immediately
when she learned that her husband had
told Elaine he would send her to college for
two years anyway, and as much longer as he
could afford. It seemed to Mrs. Jackson a
ridiculous and unwarranted expense, particularly
as he had refused to allow the term at
the Business College partly on the financial
score. She lectured, argued, scolded; but he
was firm.</p>

<p>"I told her she should, and she shall," he
repeated quietly. "She says she thinks she
can help along after a while, and you needn't
worry about her paying it back&mdash;she will, all
right, if she can. I guess she's the best of the
lot of us; she's worth the other two put together.
You let Lainey alone, Hattie, she's
all right!"</p>

<p>This was during her last year at school,
and as she had on her own responsibility taken
the classical course there, finding a fascination
in the idea of Greek, she accomplished the
preparation very easily.</p>

<p>Her mother, bowing to the inevitable, began
to plume herself on her daughter "who
was fitting herself to go to Smith's College,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and rose many degrees in the social scale because
of her. But their ideas of the necessary
preparations differed so materially, that after
prolonged and jarring hostilities marked by
much temper on both sides, the final crash
came, and after a battle royal Elaine took what
money was forthcoming and conducted her
affairs unchallenged from that moment. It was
a relief to be freed from the wearisome squabbles,
but she cried herself to sleep the night
before she left&mdash;she did not perfectly know
why. Later she told herself that it was because
she had so little reason to cry when she
left home for the first time.</p>

<p>She went to the train alone, because the
girls were at school and her father at his business.
She said good-by to her mother on the
porch, with the constraint that had grown to
characterize her attitude towards them all, but
her mother was suddenly seized with a spasm
of sentiment, and kissing her wildly, bewailed
the necessity that drove her firstborn from her
to strangers. Later the girl found it sadly characteristic
of her life, that absurd scene on the
porch; with her heart hungry and miserable
for the love and confidence she had never
known, she endured agonies of shame and
irritation at the demonstration that came too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
late. She went away, outwardly cold, with
tight-pressed lips; her mother read <i>Cometh up
as a Flower</i>, and wept hysterically that Fate
should have cursed her with such an unfeeling,
moody child.</p>

<p>It is hard to determine just what incident
convinced Susan&mdash;for she dropped the initial
on her registration&mdash;that life had not changed
for her because she was to live it in Northampton,
and that she must be alone there, as she
had been in Troy. Just before she left college
she decided that she had known it immediately:
that from the moment when she
plunged into the chattering, bustling crowd in
the Main Hall, where everybody knew somebody
and most people knew all the others, a
vague prevision of her four years' loneliness
came to her: a pathetic certainty that she could
not, even with the effort she was too proud
to make, become in any reality a part of that
sparkling, absorbed, unconscious current of
life that rushed by her.</p>

<p>Sometimes she dated her disillusionment&mdash;for
she had had her dreams: she knew them
only by the pathetic disappointment of the obstinate
awakening&mdash;from the day that she saw
her namesake laughing in the midst of a jolly
group of girls to whom she was presenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
her father and her aunt. They were handsome,
well-dressed people with a distinct air, and they
were tolerantly amused at Sue in her new environment
and showed it in a kindly, courteous
way that was much appreciated. As Susan
passed the group there was a great laugh,
and she heard Sue's voice above the rest.</p>

<p>"Truly, Papa, I thought you'd finished!
You know, whenever I interrupted, Papa
used to make me sit absolutely still for a quarter
of an hour afterward&mdash;it's not so long ago
he stopped, either!"</p>

<p>Her father laughed, and patted her shoulder,
and Susan went on out of hearing. It was
only a flash; but she saw the gracious, well-ordered
household, the handsome, dignified
people, the atmosphere of generations of good
breeding and scholarship, as clearly as if she
had visited them, and her heart swelled with
angry regret and a sickening certainty that all
the cleverness in the world could not make
up for the youth she had been cheated out
of. She thought of the bickering, squabbling
family table in Troy and tried to imagine her
father teaching Doris and Veronica not to interrupt:
her cheeks burned.</p>

<p>In class Sue was often near her; she knew
that she was recognized chiefly by the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
<i>she</i> was Susan Jackson, too. On the first day,
when the instructor had called "Miss Jackson"
and they had both answered, "Miss Susan
Jackson," when they still replied together, and
finally "Miss Susan Revere Jackson," when the
matter was cleared up, Sue had looked at her
with interest, and after the class made some
little joking remark. If the other had answered
in the same spirit, nobody knows whether this
story need have been written. But Susan had
heard Cornelia Burt ask: "Is she related at
all, Sue?" and heard Sue's answer, "Oh, dear,
no! From Troy, I believe."</p>

<p>Now Sue meant absolutely nothing but
what she said, but her namesake read into the
words a scorn that was not there&mdash;either in
intention or fact. Her heart was sore with a
hot, vague jealousy: this girl, no longer there
than she, had stepped so easily into a place
prepared, apparently, for her; she knew everybody,
went everywhere; admired by her own
class and made much of by the upper-class
girls, she was already well known in the college.
She was a part of it all&mdash;Susan only
watched it. And because of this and because
she admired her tremendously and envied her
with all the force of a passionate, repressed
nature, the poor child answered her little remark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
with a curtness that was almost insolent,
and the manner of an offended duchess. Sue
flushed a little, lifted her brows, threw a swift
glance at Cornelia, and walked away with her.
Susan heard them laughing in the hall, and
bit her lip.</p>

<p>She could not know that Sue had described
her in a letter to her father as "a queer, haughty
thing, but terribly clever. Nobody seems to
know her&mdash;I imagine she's terribly bored up
here. I said some footless thing or other to
her the other day, and she turned me down,
as Betty says. Did you meet Dr. Twitchell?
He was stopping with the Winthrops...."</p>

<p>Susan used to wonder afterwards if it would
all have been different had she been on the
campus. I know that most college people will
say that it would, and it is certain that campus
life was the best thing in the world for
Martha Williams: nobody knows with what
self-conscious egotism she might have been
spoiled if her friends and foes had not conspired
to laugh it out of her. But, on the other
hand, those who have watched the victims of
that reasonless, pitiless boycotting that only
women can accomplish so lightly&mdash;so unconsciously,
do you think?&mdash;know the ghastly
loneliness of the one who, in the very centre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
of the most crowded campus house, is more
solitary than the veriest island castaway.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Susan needed a
great deal of discipline. She had been for so
many years superior to her surroundings, so
long not only the cleverest but the finest-grained,
most aristocratic of all those she saw
about her, that although she had perfectly appreciated
the fact that she would probably no
longer be in that relative position, she had not
estimated the difficulty of the necessary adjustment,
and it is only fair to those who gave
her her hardest lessons of calm neglect to state
at once that her manner was a trifle irritating.</p>

<p>To begin with, she had made herself unpleasantly
conspicuous at the time of their
first freshman class-meeting by rising after
half an hour of unventilated and tumultuous
altercation, and leaving the room. Now it is
not the custom of popular freshmen to leave
their first class-meeting in this manner&mdash;not
as if one were faint or demanded at recitation,
but as merely intolerably bored and not a little
contemptuous; and the scrambling, squabbling
class regarded her accordingly. Susan
Revere Jackson was bored, too&mdash;unspeakably
bored; but she sat indefatigably in her chair
in the front row, applauded nominations, discussed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
the presumably parliamentary features
of the occasion, smiled and agreed, differed at
proper intervals, and left the room vice-president.
It is hard to know just how much enthusiasm
Sue really felt: Susan, to whom she
soon became the visible expression of all the
triumph and ease and distilled essence of the
successful college girl, used to wonder, later,
as older than Susan have wondered, how much
of her college life was ingenuous and how much
a perfectly conscious attitude. For long before
she left, Susan realized that she had greatly
misjudged a large proportion of the girls,
whom the event proved more practically wise
than she, and that they who fill the rôle of
"fine, all 'round girl" with the greatest success
are often perfectly competent to fill others,
widely different.</p>

<p>This she did not understand at first, and
as a result of her ignorance she included them
all in her general condemnation: she found
them immature, boisterous, inclined to be silly;
or narrow-minded and dogmatic when they
were less flippant. She was somewhat exacting,
as has been said before, and the solemn, ponderous
attitude of the occasional girl who wallows
before the abstract Higher Education,
and lectures the Faculty gravely on their failure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
to conduct her to its most eminent peaks
during the freshman year, appealed as strongly
to her sense of humor as if she had not herself
been sadly disappointed in the somewhat restricted
curriculum offered her at that period.</p>

<p>This was through no fault whatever of the
college, but because the girl had absolutely no
practical basis of expectation and knew no more
of the thousand implications of college life than
she did of normal girlhood with its loves and
disciplines and confidences, its tremendous little
social experiences, its quaint emotions, and
indispensable hypocrisies. Her vague conception
of college life was modelled on <i>The Princess</i>:
she imagined graceful, gracious women,
enamoured of a musical, poetic, higher knowledge,
deliciously rapt at the wonderful oratory
of some priestess of a cult yet unknown
to her: a woman beautiful and passionate,
who should understand her vaguest dreams
and sympathize with her strangest sorrows as
no one she had yet known or seen could do.
She found a crowd of jostling, chattering
schoolgirls, unformed, unpoised; many of
them vulgar, many stupid, many ill-bred;
overflowing a damp, cold hall that smelled of
wet, washed floors; reciting, in a very average
fashion, perfectly concrete and ordinary lessons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
from text-books only too familiar, to businesslike,
middle-aged women, rather plain than
otherwise, with a practical grasp of the matter
in hand and a marked preference for regular
attendance on the part of freshmen.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of her that what cut
deepest in all the disillusionment was not the
loss of the hope, but the shamed perception
of the folly of it, the realization of the depth
of practical ignorance it implied, the perfectly
conscious pathos of a life so empty of real experience
of the world as to make such naïve
visions possible. She did the required work
and kept her thoughts about it to herself, but
the effect of what she secretly felt to have been
a provincial and ridiculous mistake showed itself
in her manner; and the occasional hauteur
of her namesake, who had inherited a very effective
stare of her own, was diffidence itself
compared with the reserved disdain that covered
her own smarting sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Girls who had tumbled about with their
kind from babyhood, who had found at home,
at church, at school a varied if simple social
training, resented her formality and could not
see that pure shyness of them, pure wonder
at their rough-and-ready ease of manner, their
amazing power of adjustment, their quick grasp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
of the situation and each other, lay at the root
of her jealous dignity.</p>

<p>So she called them "Miss," and they thought
her affected; she waited for invitations that
she should have taken for granted, and they
thought her haughty; she made no advance
in a place where only the very favored are
sought out and most must earn even the humblest
recognition with honest toil and assiduous
advertisement, and they quietly let her
alone. She was not on the campus, and as the
girls in the small boarding-house with her were
industrious and ordinary to the last degree and
became very early impressed with her realization
of this fact, she saw little of them, and her
one opportunity of getting the campus gossip,
which is the college gossip, grew smaller and
smaller. She took solitary walks, thereby confirming
the impression that she preferred to be
alone&mdash;for who need be alone among a thousand
girls unless she wishes it?</p>

<p>On such a walk, late in the fall, she stood
for some time on one of the hills that rise
above the town proper, looking for the hundredth
time at the mountains, outlined that
afternoon against the dying light of a brassy,
green sky. The trees were bare and black about
her; the lights in the comfortable houses were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
flushing up the windows with a happy evening
red; belated children were hurrying home; and
now and then groups of girls, fresh-cheeked
from their quick walk, swung by, in haste for
supper and their evening engagements. Over
her heart, hungry and misunderstood, there
poured a sudden flood of passionate longing
for one hour of unconscious happy comradeship
with homes and girls like these; one
hour of some one else's&mdash;anybody else's&mdash;life;
one taste of dependence on another than
herself. It fell into rhythm and fascinating
phrases while she gave herself up to the
mood, and she made a poem of it that night.
In two days she was famous, for High Authority
publicly placed the poem above anything
yet done in the college; it was seized
by the <i>Monthly</i>, and copied widely in the
various college publications; to the editorial
board and the Faculty who did not have other
reason for knowing her, she became "the girl
who wrote <i>At Autumn Dusk</i>." It was long before
she equalled it, though almost everything
she did was far above a college standard; and
one or two people will always think it her best
poem, I have no doubt, in spite of more recent
and perhaps more striking work.</p>

<p>For this poem was only the beginning, it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
as well be admitted now, of Susan's career as a
genius. This degree is frequently conferred, no
doubt, when unmerited; but the article is so
susceptible of imitation, the recipe for producing
the traditional effect so comparatively simple,
that it is to be wondered at, on the whole,
that the aspirants for the title should be, among
so many clever young women, so relatively few.
To a frank and recently awakened interest in
Shelley, Keats, Rossetti, and Co., it is only
necessary to add a vacant abstraction, a forgetfulness
of conventional meal hours&mdash;supper,
for choice&mdash;a somewhat occult system of
reply to ordinary remarks, and the courage of
one's convictions in the matter of bursting out
with the irrelevant results of previous and prolonged
meditation irrespective of the conversation
of the moment. Any one who will combine
with these infallible signs of the fire from
heaven as much carelessness in the matter of
dress as her previous bringing up will allow&mdash;though
this is naturally a variable quantity&mdash;and
a certain unmistakable looseness of <i>coiffure</i>&mdash;was
there ever a genius with taut hair?
heaven avert it!&mdash;may be reasonably certain
of recognition. It is understood, of course, that
with the qualifications above mentioned a taste
for verse and an ear for rhythm, in conjunction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
with the frank appreciation of the poetical firm
also above mentioned, have produced their inevitable
result.</p>

<p>The character of the output naturally has
something to do with the extent of the reputation,
and although Susan, the most promising
candidate for the degree then in the field,
had alarmingly few of the most obvious signs
of her rank, this was indulgently passed over,
and she was allowed her laurels.</p>

<p>But it was Sue Jackson on whom all the
first congratulations were heaped: roses and
violets, that blossom at the slightest excuse in
Northampton, covered the hall table in the
Hubbard House, where she spent her first two
years; affectionate and mock-reverential notes
crowded the bulletin board for her; a spread
was actually got up and the guests invited before
the mistake was known. To do her justice
she would have promptly despatched the notes
and flowers to her defrauded namesake, but the
donors, whom she consulted, would have none
of it.</p>

<p>"Why, Sue! Why, the idea! <i>Didn't</i> you
write it? Oh, girls, what a joke! How perfectly
funny!&mdash;Send 'em to her? Not at all.
Why on earth should Neal and I send that
girl flowers? For that matter, she cut us dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
day before yesterday, on Round Hill, didn't
she, Pat? And she's in our Greek, too. We'll
have the stuff to eat, anyhow. You're a nice
old thing, Sue, if you can't write 'this extraordinary
poem'!"</p>

<p>Susan, who heard next to nothing of college
news, heard about this. She heard how
Sue had gayly responded to toasts: "The
Poem I did not write," "My Feelings on
failing to compose my Masterpiece"&mdash;this
was Neal Burt's, and she was very clever over
it&mdash;and others. The only thing she did not
hear about was Sue's half-serious response to
"My gifted God-child," suggested by an upper-class
friend. She made a little graceful fun
and then added quite earnestly, "And really,
girls, I <i>do</i> think she ought to be here! After
all, the Class, you know&mdash;Let's take down
the flowers and all the fudge&mdash;come on! She
can't do more than squelch us!"</p>

<p>The very girls who had scoffed at the idea
before were naturally the ones to take it up immediately,
and they were hastily gathering the
things together, when the bell rang. They
could not hope to get there and back before
ten, and most of them were already deep in
the matron's black list for reported lights; so
they gave it up, and put the flowers in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
tub, where a sudden frost over night struck
them and they perished miserably.</p>

<p>To Susan it was the bitterest thing of all; it
took the sweetness from her success; it dulled
the piquancy of her sudden position. She could
not possibly know how little it meant to Sue;
that it was only one of many spreads, and by
no means the triumphal feast she imagined;
that after the first they forgot why they had
planned it, almost. To her it was her chance
at life, her long-delayed birthright, and Sue
had taken it, too, along with everything else.
"She might have left me that!"&mdash;it was her
thought for more than one unhappy night.</p>

<p>Before she went home in June she had
written a Chaucer paper that became vaguely
confounded in the matter of literary rank with
the works of its famous subject, in her class-mates'
simple minds, so great was the commendation
of Another High Authority in
regard to its matter and style. It came out
in the May <i>Monthly</i>, in which were some
pretty little verses of Sue's. They were paraphrased
from the French&mdash;Sue had taken
any amount of French before she came up&mdash;and
Susan spent her time at chapel in looking
harder than ever at her namesake as she
laughed and chattered and took her part in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the somewhat crudely conceived jokes that
seem to amuse girls so perennially. Less flexible,
as she afterwards considered, less hypocritical,
as she irritably felt then, she marvelled
at the mental make-up of a girl capable of appreciating
the force and pathos of De Musset's
best work and expressing it so accurately, and
able at the same time to find content in such
tiresome, half-grown nonsense.</p>

<p>When the <i>Monthly</i> came out, she was amazed
to receive a dozen copies with a hasty note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>DEAR Miss Jackson: Here are the copies you
wanted&mdash;never mind the money. There
are always a lot left over since we enlarged the
edition. If you want more, after we've sent out
the Alumnæ list, we'll give them to you.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap left45">H. Stuart.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was only one of the many notes intended
for Sue that had been coming to her since the
beginning. But none of the invitations to dinner,
to Alpha and Phi Kappa, to walk, to ride,
to wheel, to eat a box from home, had the
effect of this one. For Sue came after her
<i>Monthlies</i> and in a ten minutes' conversation
wrought more ruin than she would have believed
possible.</p>

<p>"Did you get all mine and your own, too?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
she asked laughingly. "I should send away
a hundred, more or less, if <i>I</i> did 'absolutely
satisfactory' Chaucer papers! I should be
that proud....</p>

<p>"You see, Papa has to have the <i>Monthly</i>,
if there's anything of mine in it, <i>tout de suite</i>&mdash;directly&mdash;now.
He was wild with rage at
me because he learned about that little fool
story I had in, once before, from Cousin Con,
'long afterwards,' he said&mdash;it was only a
week! And then, other people, you know....</p>

<p>"Did you get any of these off, before I
came? Because it's all right if you did&mdash;I
don't need a dozen. Isn't it funny I don't
get any of your things? You must be somewhat
cloyed with my notes and stuff&mdash;I should
think you'd be bored to death. It's very wearing
on me, Miss Jackson, explaining all the
time, 'No, I'm not the one! I assure you I
didn't write it.' You've no idea....</p>

<p>"My cousin is on the <i>Harvard Monthly</i>
board, you know&mdash;he telegraphed congratulations
to me. He was that set up over it!
It was really very funny....</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm keeping you&mdash;were you
going out? Shall I tell Helen Stuart to send
yours down? She may think we've both got
all we want. Do you know what Alpha's going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
to be to-night? Somebody said it was going
to be Dr. Winthrop&mdash;he's my uncle,
you know, and I thought if it was I'd go
down to the station...."</p>

<p>She had not the slightest idea that her
thoughtless and, to tell the truth, somewhat
embarrassed chatter was one succession of
little galling pinpricks to the other. Her father,
who expected his daughter's little triumphs
to be his own, as a matter of course;
her cousin at Harvard; her uncle who lectured
to the Alpha; her notes and flowers&mdash;she
must know that there was the best of reasons
for her not getting her namesake's!&mdash;her light
implication that everybody went to Alpha;
her very expression: "No, I'm not the one!"
seemed to the girl's angry sensitiveness a
studied insult. Not the one! As if there were
any one else! She did not know how unbearably
formal and curt she seemed to the other,
nor how strongly she gave the impression of
wanting to be let alone.</p>

<p>Sue went away to mail her <i>Monthlies</i>, and
Susan locked her door and considered at
length and in detail the humor of her visitor's
light remarks as applied to herself. She
fancied <i>At Autumn Dusk</i> and <i>A Study of Chaucer</i>
demanded by an enraged father, and smiled&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
very unpleasant and ungirlish smile. Moreover,
it is possible that she did her father an
injustice here. While it is improbable that he
would have persisted in lending them about
among his friends, to his wife's open amusement,
as did Mr. Jackson of Boston, and notwithstanding
the fact that he would doubtless
have failed to appreciate them fully, he might
have liked to see them. Later, much later, Susan
was to find a number of her poems and stories
clipped with care from the magazines and pasted
into an old scrapbook, with the glowing notices
of her first really well-known work; the book
hidden under a pile of old newspapers in her
father's closet. She cried over them for days&mdash;he
was dead then&mdash;and published <i>Blind
Hearts</i> shortly afterward. None of her class-mates,
most of whom gave or received that
exquisite sonnet-cycle for Christmas that year,
could have known that the roots of it struck
back to her freshman year at college.</p>

<p>After a stupid, hot vacation, in which she
lost touch more than ever with her people,
from whom she was to draw slowly apart, it
seemed, forever, she came back with a little,
unowned hope for other things: a vague idea
that she could start fresh. She told somebody,
afterwards, that just as she got to understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
girls a little she lost all connection
with them; she did not lose connection with
them just then, so it must be that she did not
then understand them.</p>

<p>Indeed, what was, perhaps, her greatest
mistake was made at this time, and colored the
year for her. It happened in this way. The
Alpha had the first chance at the sophomores
that year, and for a wonder, the sophomores
were not only clever but possessed that intangible
quality, "the Alpha spirit," in a
gratifying degree. The ticket for the first drawing
included the two Jacksons, Cornelia Burt,
Elizabeth Twitchell, and to fulfil that tradition
that inevitably elects one perfectly unexplainable
girl, Kate Ackley, a young person
of many and judiciously selected friends. At
the very night of the election it was suddenly
rumored that Sue Jackson had openly declared
her intention of refusing Alpha in favor
of the rival society, on the ground that she
liked Phi Kappa better and had more friends
there.</p>

<p>Now aside from the fact that this report
was utterly baseless, for Sue would have preferred
the Alpha, if only to go in among the
first five of all, it was aside from the point.
As some irritated seniors afterwards explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
with much temper and reiteration to the chidden
society, Alpha was sufficiently honorable
in the sight of the college to endure very
calmly rejection at the hands of any freshman
whatsoever, whether or not they had any
certainty of the truth of the rumor. But the
girls were struck with the solemn necessity of
immediate and drastic action, and with a gratifying
thrill of excitement they struck off Sue's
name and put in Margaret Pattison's, the
sixth in order, whereat Phi Kappa greatly rejoiced
and promptly elected Sue the next
week.</p>

<p>Now it is very sad that the only person who
seriously misunderstood this whole affair was
Susan Jackson of Troy. Sue very quickly
learned the whole matter; what her feelings
may have been is not certain. Phi Kappa
made a jubilee over her, and she became, as
is well known, a great light in that society.
Miss Pattison, by some mysterious free masonry&mdash;the
girls who are "in everything"
seem to absorb all such matters through their
pores&mdash;soon found out her luck, and was
frankly grateful for it. Alpha retained the
courage of her convictions and assumed a distinctly
here-I-stand-I-can-no-otherwise attitude.
Phi Kappa chuckled privately and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
looked puzzled in public. But Susan had made
a great mistake, and what is worse, never
knew it. A little gossiping freshman in the
boarding-house she had moved into, who had
been injudiciously petted by the seniors and
imagined herself in everybody's confidence,
told Miss Jackson, with many vows of secrecy,
that there had never been such a time
in Alpha in the history of the college: they
had meant to have Sue&mdash;oh, of course!&mdash;but
there had been a terrible mistake at the balloting
and names had been confused, and
though etiquette forbade any expression of
their real feeling, they were nearly wild at their
clumsiness.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be wondered at that Susan
jumped to her conclusion. She had got so
many things intended for Sue&mdash;why not this?
She knew that cleverness and even college
fame are not the only calls to a society, and
she had no real friends in either of the two
organizations. She could not believe that the
Alpha would purposely omit Sue: if they had
chosen both, it would have been different, but
as it was....</p>

<p>So she received their very earnest congratulations
with a constraint that chilled them.
They reasoned that she was perfectly certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
of the election and took no pains to hide it,
and though they could not blame her for this,
they thought her more conceited than ever,
and regarded her accordingly. The poor child
was suffering from actual humility, however,
not conceit. She could not know that her
mark on both society lists was the highest
ever given; that Alpha would cheerfully have
sacrificed any two, or even three, of the others
for her; that much as they regretted Sue, they
wasted less sorrow over her now that they were
sure of the leading girl in Ninety-red. For that
was what they called her&mdash;the girls that she
thought patronized her. They took her after-successes
almost as a matter of course. "Oh,
yes! she was far and away the most brilliant
girl in the college!" they said. But she never
heard them.</p>

<p>The house she had moved into with an unacknowledged
hope of getting more in touch
with them was the last house she should have
chosen. It was filled from cellar to roof with
freshmen, and not only are they notoriously
clannish under such conditions, but there were
at least eight or ten of them from the same
prominent preparatory school, and among
them was their class president. It was not
possible for Susan to join herself to this little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
circle of satellites, and they controlled the entire
house in a very short time. So she took
to visiting the head of the house, a faded,
placid soul with a nominal authority and a
gentleness that moved even her worst freshmen&mdash;and
a bad freshman combines the brutality
of a boy with the finesse of a woman of
the world&mdash;to a little shamed consideration
during their periodic fits of social reform. Sitting
by her fire in the dusk, with the smell of
hot cooked chocolate drifting in from the hall,
and the din of the assembled tribes in the
president's room overhead, Susan passed long,
bored, miserable hours. Half listening to the
older woman's talk, half sunk in her thoughts,
she alternately chafed with rage at the idea of
her college life drifting out in solitary walks
and tired women's confidences, or took a sad
kind of comfort in one fire where she was
always welcome, one friend that loved to talk
to her.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Hudson grew very fond of her,
and something in the girl's own baffled, unsatisfied
soul must have helped her to understand
the stress and pathos of the tired little
woman's life. Few of the girls who afterwards
read <i>Barbara: A Study in Discipline</i>, would
have believed that the high-hearted, wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
heroine was based on Miss Jackson's study of
their freshman landlady. But most of Susan's
knowledge was gained from such unscheduled
courses.</p>

<p>In her junior year she let her work go, to
a great extent, and spent much time in the
town libraries, reading omnivorously. As a
matter of fact, her class work deteriorated not
a little, as much by reason of dangerously extended
cuts as anything else. But it all failed
to interest her, somehow: the detailed campaigns,
the actual value of money, the soulless
translations, the necessarily primary character
of the beginnings of any study of modern
language. She felt with growing irritation that
she should have learned genders and verbs
earlier in life, and she surprised her expectant
teachers with poorer and poorer recitations.
Mademoiselle had no means of knowing that
though Miss Jackson stammered through the
subjunctive she was reading dozens of novels
and plays with a very fair ease; Fräulein could
not tell from her imperfect handling of the
modal auxiliaries that she had written a better
paper on <i>Faust</i> than many a six years' student
of German, and already knew most of Heine
by heart.</p>

<p>This year she made a few friends, chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
in Phi Kappa, for some reason or other, which
irritated the Alpha girls a little. To do her
justice, she was utterly ignorant of this result
of her connection with Bertha Kitts and
Alida Fosdick, nor would it have resulted in
the case of an ordinary girl. But Susan was
more prominent than she ever realized, and
her whole connection with the others being
official and logical rather than social and actual,
her conduct and opinions were very sharply
criticised from a rather exacting standpoint.
Nor was this wholly unfair, for she was herself
an unsparing critic. More than one of the
Faculty smarted under her too successful epigrams;
various aspirants for popularity and
power in the Alpha or the class learned to
dread her comments; her few friends themselves
were never quite sure of her attitude
toward them. But she was not, for her part,
sure of them: it is hard to make friends in
one's junior year. And though she saw quite
a little of Biscuits and Dick and Neal Burt&mdash;always
her constant admirer&mdash;she never
for a moment lost the consciousness that she
was no friend of their friends, that she had no
place in those groups long since formed and
shaken into place. They were a little jealous of
her, too, and resented her selection of this girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
and that from among them, though they could
not but admit that her judgment was good.</p>

<p>Her sources of irritation were the same always.
Their very flexibility, the ease with which
those she had chosen out slipped from her to
their other friends (they laughed with her at
them, even, after the manner of girls&mdash;did they
laugh with them at her?), filled her with a
hopeless jealousy. It was not their nice clothes
and their good times she grudged them, though
she wanted both: it was their connections, their
environments, their very disciplines. When
Biscuits with loud lamentations elected Philosophy
at the decree of her father; when
Neal took up two courses of Economics in
order to help her mother with "some footless
syllabi in mother's literary club;" when Betty
Twitchell endured the gibes of her friends every
rainy day because "Papa won't let me wear a
short skirt; he hates a woman in one&mdash;I think
it's perfectly horrid of him, too! Wait till I get
pneumonia! As if I'd 'get a carriage' to take
me from the Hatfield to College Hall!" Susan
would have given every rhyme in her head for
one year of their conventional, irresponsible
lives.</p>

<p>It was not money she longed for: Neal
Burt was poor enough, and made no secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
of "my cousin's boots, my dear, and my aunt's
silk waist, and Patsy's gloves that don't fit her,
that I have on this minute!" But Neal gave
her one of her worst quarter-hours, at the time
her mother came up. She was a pretty little
woman with Neal's eyes; her simple clothes
had, like Neal's, a distinct air of taste and selection
about them; her interest in everything
was so pleasant, her manner so cordial and
charming, that she made an easy conquest of
the girls and Neal's friends in the Faculty
that came to meet her and drink tea in the
quiet house where Neal lived almost alone,
much petted by her landlady, an old family
friend. Mrs. Burt was interested in Economics
that year&mdash;"the dear thing has a new fad
every time I go home!"&mdash;and a prominent
professor of Economics from one of the universities
happening to be in town just then,
one of Neal's friends among the Powers invited
mother and daughter to meet him. Mrs.
Burt was equally charmed and charming; the
distinguished professor begged to be allowed
to send her a copy of his book, in which she
had been much interested, "and she went home
proud as Punch!" in the words of her daughter.</p>

<p>Every word the kindly little woman had
with Susan&mdash;and she had a great many, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Neal had interested her mother in her friend&mdash;brought
closer home to her what had steadily
grown to be the consuming trouble of her life.
She tried to imagine <i>her</i> mother drinking tea
with a roomful of strangers; finding the right
word for every one, talking with this girl about
her friends, with that about the last book, with
the other about college life in general. She
fancied her meeting the distinguished professor
and discussing his book so brightly&mdash;and
saw the closet-shelves where Marie Corelli and
the Duchess jostled Edna Lyall: Mrs. Jackson
said she liked some real heavy reading
now and then, and Edna Lyall had a good
many problems in her books. She had a sickening
consciousness that her mother would inevitably
defer to the girls, particularly to the
confident, well-dressed ones; and every time
that Neal patted Mrs. Burt's shoulder or
kissed the tip of her ear, she felt her heart
contract with a spasm of that terrible gnawing
envy that is surely reserved, with their equally
terrible capacity for loving, for a certain small
proportion of women, and women only. It is
a very sad thing for a girl to be ashamed of
her mother.</p>

<p>In her junior year occurred one of her greatest
triumphs. The senior class had petitioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
vainly for the privilege of giving <i>Twelfth
Night</i> as their Commencement play: the refusal,
based on the obstacle presented by the
part of Sir Toby, and couched in the undying
phrases of the Greatest Authority&mdash;"he
should be neither drunk, nor half drunk, nor
bibulous, nor rioting"&mdash;impressed very deeply
those more susceptible to the humorous. With
a commendable intelligence the dramatics committee
decided that under the limitations above
quoted the play would lack in verisimilitude,
and cast about for another, but that was not
the end of it; for Susan, in whose hands the
Alpha farewell-meeting had been unreservedly
placed, wrote, staged, and directed the performance
of an elaborate parody entitled <i>First
Night</i>, from which "the objectionable element
in the unfortunate William's comedy," to quote
the preface, was successfully and unsparingly
expurgated.</p>

<p>Not only were the most obvious situations
cleverly treated; not only did Sir Toby, spare
and ascetic, in a neat flannel wrapper, call decorously
for "a stoup of thin gruel, Maria!"
not only did he and his self-contained friends
walk through a kind of posture dance with
killing solemnity, chanting the while a staid
canon in which the possibilities of "Why,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
should I drink on <i>one</i> day?" were interpreted
with a novel and gratifying morality; not only
did Malvolio utterly eschew an article of apparel
too likely to bring the blush of shame
to the cheek of the Young Person, but painstakingly
assume, in the eyes of the delighted
audience, heavy woollen stockings, a constant
and effectual reminder of his hidden traditional
garb: but a parody within a parody ran
cunningly through the piece. The trials of the
committee, the squabbles of the principal actors,
open hits at the Faculty, sly comments
on the senior class, which had been active in
reforms and not wholly popular innovations&mdash;all
these were interwoven with the farce;
and this not in the clumsy harmless fashion
of most college grinds, but pointed by a keen
wit, a merciless satire, an easy, brilliant style
already well on to its now recognized maturity.</p>

<p>Most of the principal actors in the play finally
selected by the seniors, with more than
half of the committee, were that year, as it happened,
from Alpha, and their delight knew no
bounds. Susan did not act herself, but she was
a born manager; and the actors that cursed
her unsparing drill and absolute authority during
the long rehearsal season that made it
the most finished affair of its kind, blessed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
vociferously on the great night of its production.
It was the most perfect success of her life&mdash;though
the girls who thought she scorned
her college triumphs would have laughed had
she told them so, later. Every point was eagerly
caught and wildly applauded; the stage setting,
the funny, clever costumes, the irresistible caricatures,
the wit and humor of the thing, all
acted with a <i>verve</i> and precision unusual in
college dramatics, where criticism is too often
forced to take the will for the deed, all called
for a tremendous and well-earned appreciation.
The author was frantically summoned
again and again; the seniors exhausted a congratulatory
vocabulary on her. Her classmates
shook her hand many times apiece.</p>

<p>Nor did the triumph end with the night,
for the juniors, unable to contain their pride,
gave surreptitious bits of the play to chosen
seniors in Phi Kappa, and it was even rumored
that the other society was going to
request a revival of the combination entertainment,
now out of vogue, with a view to
having it repeated. This was suppressed by
the Powers, but it got about that one of the
few type-written copies of the piece had fallen
into the hands of an Influential Person&mdash;probably
through Neal Burt, who admired it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
proportion to her own far from ordinary ability&mdash;and
that the Person had assembled a select
gathering of her Peers for the sole purpose
of reading it, with unmistakably appreciative
comments, to them. Some members of the
Faculty, old Alpha girls themselves, and present
on the occasion of its production, expressed
their admiration in unstinted terms, and altogether
the Alpha gained a tremendous prestige.</p>

<p>This and her appointment as editor-in-chief
of the <i>Monthly</i> for her senior year marked
the height of Susan's prosperity. She used to
think, afterwards, that the play was the only
pure pleasure she had ever had: it was certainly
the only one that her namesake had left
to her unspoiled. Fate ordered it that she
should take off the bulletin-board with her
notice of editorial appointment a note hastily
addressed to S. Jackson, '9-. She opened it
mechanically.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>DEAR Old Sue: It's a miserable shame! You
ought to have had it! But it seems that it
makes no difference what we want, nor who would
work in best with the girls.</i> Genius <i>isn't everything,
always&mdash;but you know what I wanted!</i></p>

<p class="left45"><i>Your disappointed</i><br />

<span class="left25">H. S. K.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>The note was not sealed, and she folded it
and put it back quietly. A moment later she
received her congratulations, but to every
one's "Of course you're not surprised, Miss
Jackson!" she smiled strangely. Sue used the
phrase, fresh from her own congratulations
as literary editor, and the concentrated bitterness
of three years flashed out in the other's
curt answer.</p>

<p>"Of course you're not surprised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Are you?</i>"</p>

<p>Sue's startled flush was all the proof she
needed, and crushing in her hand the note that
had meant the highest college honor to more
than one of the girls who had got its like, she
went home to bear alone the sharpest disappointment
she had yet known.</p>

<p>There was no one to tell her that the senior
editor whose initials signed the note for Sue
had been one of only two in Sue's favor; that
the board, so far from acting unwillingly under
the direction of the Rhetoric department,
as she inferred from the note, had been practically
unanimous for her, particularly as the
two opposed held relatively unimportant positions
and were far from popular. She did
not know that the note itself was a gross
breach of etiquette, anyway, and that both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
officially and socially its writer had risked the
gravest censure; so much so that Sue, far
from being pleased, was heartily ashamed of
it and never told a soul about it till long afterwards.
The person who could have explained
most effectively to her how perfectly her election
met the favor of everybody, herself included&mdash;for
Sue would have been as surprised
to find herself placed above her gifted namesake
as to have found herself omitted entirely
from the board&mdash;was too chagrined at the
abrupt answer to her congratulations to dream
of mentioning the matter further.</p>

<p>So Susan got out her first two numbers of
the <i>Monthly</i> with none of the delighted importance
of most editors. It was all spoiled
for her. She knew that she deserved it: it
was impossible for her not to realize that, so
far as originality and power went, nobody in
the class, or the college, for that matter, could
touch her work. It was not the position that
meant so much to her: she was perfectly competent
to fill it easily and acceptably, and she
knew it. But she wanted them to think so,
too, and be glad to give it to her&mdash;and she
did not believe they were.</p>

<p>Shortly after her success of <i>First Night</i>,
she got one of her rare letters from home. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
had little correspondence with them, and had
grown to regard their letters with dread, since
each one had brought unpleasant news, from
Doris', to announce her engagement to one of
"the boys," a flashy, half-disreputable fellow,
to her mother's, enclosing a cheque, with
gloomy forebodings that it might be the last,
and a disheartening chronicle of family affairs
growing daily more sordid. The sight of her
characterless, uncultivated handwriting always
threw the girl into a gloomy, irritable mood,
and as she opened this one the remorse that
had begun to prick her more sharply of late
at her inability to help them, if not in the way
she would like, at least in the most obviously
necessary manner, crept over her and saddened
her even before she reached the crisis
of the letter. It was very simple: she must
come home. There was no more money; there
had been none for some time, but her father
was bent on her staying, and had put it off
longer than he should have done. It had been
a foolish expense, and she might have had a
position long ago. There was car fare and a very
little over, and it was hoped that she had no
bills. They were going to move into an apartment
over the store, and Veronica was going
to keep her father's books. And that was all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps her mother felt sorrier than she
knew how to say; perhaps it was only the constraint
of years and lack of <i>savoir faire</i> that made
the letter so cold and curt; but there it was,
with nothing to break the shock: no regret for
her, to lighten her sense of selfishness; no appeal
to her, even, to help them. They could get
along very well; to give up the house would
be a great financial relief, and she would be
more a hindrance than otherwise. She knew
that: she knew that her presence would be a
constant irritation, her criticism, impossible
to conceal, a constant source of strife and estrangement.
It was only that they had no more
money for her&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>She walked out to the long bridge, and
sat down on a stone near the end of it. For
perhaps the first time a complete consciousness
of how bitterly she loved the place came
to her. She, of whom many of the Faculty
afterwards wondered that she stayed as long
as she did, credited by all her acquaintances
with infinite boredom at its restrictions and
wearisome routine, dreaded to leave it as
she herself could hardly endure to think.
For three years she had taken a place, unchallenged,
among people of a class she had
never known before. Unknown, unhelped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
she had by sheer personality and natural
power made herself not only respected but
respected to an unusual degree. She had
patronized girls who would not have acknowledged
her existence three years before;
whether they loved her or not, her class
was proud of her. Her going would be noticed&mdash;oh,
yes indeed!</p>

<p>She rose to go home, and a little beyond
the bridge turned to look back: something
told her that she should not know that view
soon again. Meadow and river and softly circling
hills with the beautiful afternoon haze
thick on them, she stamped it on her heart&mdash;and
with it a sudden nearing figure. Down
the long arch, slim and shapely against the
blue background of the tunnel, Sue flew
toward her on her wheel. Her hands swung
by her sides&mdash;she had ridden from childhood&mdash;her
feet were off the pedals, her perfectly
fitting heavy skirt hung out in graceful fluted
folds. Beneath her soft, trim hat her cheeks
glowed rose-color, her eyes shone like stars.
The sun caught her smooth, thick hair and
framed her face in a glittering halo. She sat
straight as a dart, her lips parted with the
sheer physical delight of the swooping, effortless
sensation&mdash;she was tremendously handsome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
To the other girl she was victory incarnate;
the essence of ease and triumph and perfect
<i>bien-être</i>; her hopeless envy and despair.
As she flew by she spread out her hands in
a quick, significant gesture, half graceful and
high-bred&mdash;half pert and of the music-hall:
it typified her and her friends perfectly to Susan,
who never forgot her as she saw her then,
and whose <i>Mademoiselle Diana</i>, much admired
by Sue and her family, is nobody more nor
less than Sue herself.</p>

<p>She found a letter waiting for her at home,
a letter that the maid explained had just been
brought from the house where the other Miss
Jackson lived&mdash;it had been kept there by
mistake and neglected for two or three days.
It was hoped it was not important. She opened
it in the hall, read it hastily through, read it
again, looked at the date, and asked for a
time-table. The maid, suspecting bad news,
was officious in assistance and eagerly agreed
to pack her things and get a man to box the
books when she had gone, which would be in
the morning, she said, with a strange, absent-minded
air. She gave the girl her last fifty
cents, and while Maggie folded and packed,
she wrote a letter home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>It seems foolish for me to come to Troy; I
should only have to go right back to Boston
again</i>," she said in it. "<i>They want me to begin to
collect the stories right away and do some reading
for them besides&mdash;so I must be there. There is a
new magazine they have just bought, too, and I am
to do some work on that. It is a very good position
and will lead to a better, they say, and I am
very fortunate to get it. They say very nice things
about my work in the "Monthly"&mdash;the college
paper that I was elected editor of&mdash;they seem to
have read them all. I must go on immediately.
Their letter was delayed, and I shall try to get
there to-morrow. I will let you know when I find
a place to stay. I hope to be able to help you soon.</i></p>

<p class="left45">"<i>Hastily</i>,<br />
<span class="left25">"<span class="smcap">Susan</span>."</span></p>
</div>

<p>She wrote a note to the Registrar and one
to Neal Burt, whom, in her letter of resignation,
she recommended strongly to the board
as her successor, overlooking the constitution,
which provides for the literary editor's filling
the first place when it falls vacant, and refusing
supper, she walked out over the campus.
The dining-rooms were opened to the soft air;
the cheerful clatter of plates came out from
every window; she could see the maids hurrying
about. She sat for an hour in one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
hammocks, and then walked about the larger
buildings. The last dance of the season was
on in the Gym; the violins rose above the
tramping and the confused uproar inside.
White-armed girls passed the windows and
leaned out into the cool.</p>

<p>"How is it?" one called up from below.</p>

<p>"Mortal slow, dearie, but don't say I told
you!" the other answered in a stage whisper
from above, and the music dashed into a
two-step.</p>

<p>"Be<i>hold</i> El <i>Cap</i>-i-<i>tan</i>!"</p>

<p>It haunted Susan's dreams for nights, that
tune&mdash;it seemed impossible that the dancers'
hearts should not ache as hers did. She lingered,
fascinated, while the violins sang it
over and over, and over again at the storm of
clapping that followed it.</p>

<p>"Be<i>hold</i> El <i>Cap</i>-i-<i>tan</i>!"</p>

<p>It was a hideous, cruel tune, light and utterly
careless, and yet with that little sadness in it
that some sensitive ears find always in good
dance music&mdash;is it because dancing must so
obviously end so soon?&mdash;and Susan has
loathed it all her life. Indeed, at a recent luncheon
given in her honor by the alumnæ of
New York, she requested that the orchestra
stop playing it after the first few bars&mdash;these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
people of genius are so delightfully eccentric!</p>

<p>She left college as quietly as she had entered
it; there is no doubt that they would
have made her Ivy Orator, had she stayed.
The mail that took the notice of her lodging-house
to her family crossed one of Sue's to
her Uncle Bradford, of the well-known Boston
publishing firm. Among other things she
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>I'm glad you like her so well&mdash;I knew you
would. She's really much better for the place
than Con. And I'm sure it was better to write to
her directly&mdash;she doesn't like any of us very well,
except Neal and Biscuits, and I have an idea
she really almost dislikes me. I knew that when
you saw that essay on the French and English as
short-story writers, you'd want to give her the
chance. And she was the very girl to leave college,
too&mdash;it isn't everybody would be so glad
to go just before senior year. Not but what I would,
fast enough, if I had her future before me&mdash;Mon
dieu! she's the only girl I ever thought I'd
rather be&mdash;you should see the poem she left with
Neal for the "Monthly"! She turns them off over
night, apparently. It's a loss to the class, of course,
but everybody is very glad for her&mdash;she always
seemed so out of place up here, somehow. If one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
doesn't care for the little footless stunts, it must
be a terrible bore, I should think. And when she's
famous we can pat each other on the back and say
we done it&mdash;partly. With a great deal of love
for you and Aunt Julia,</i></p>

<p class="stories">VII<br />

A FEW DIVERSIONS</p>

<p>"I wish you <i>would</i> ask her up, Nan,"
said Mrs. Harte, confidentially. "I want
her to see the place. So far as I can judge,
it's the best thing for her. There isn't
any doubt that she's a very bright girl, but she's
getting thoroughly spoiled here. You see, she
does just as she pleases&mdash;she's the only young
person in the family&mdash;and I know we spoil
her terribly. Her mind is made up to come
out in the winter, here in Chicago, and they'll
refuse her nothing&mdash;her father and mother."</p>

<p>"They <i>don't</i> seem what you'd call oppressively
strict with her," remarked Anne, twirling
her racquet.</p>

<p>"Now what I want is for her to get somewhere
where she isn't the only clever girl; to
see that other girls can read and talk and play
the guitar and wear nice clothes and order silly
young men about. And judging from those of
you that I've seen, you can!"</p>

<p>"We do our little best," said Anne, modestly.</p>

<p>"And I wanted her to see you all: that's
one reason why I planned the house-party. I
was so disappointed when she came so late.
You see, her cousin Georgiana was&mdash;was unfortunate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
She went to Yale and Columbia and
goodness knows where, and she had short hair
and was such a frump and she wore such hideous
spectacles and talked about Socialism&mdash;or
was it Sociology?&mdash;all the time. I remember
she was always trying to persuade us to join
clubs and protest against something or other&mdash;it
was very wearisome. So Madge got to despise
the whole thing: she has always thrown
Georgiana at me when I mentioned college.
It was perfectly useless to try to make her understand
that every girl needn't be like Georgiana.
She's very obstinate. But she's a nice
girl, too, and if she can only get out of her
present atmosphere for four years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pity she couldn't have seen Ursula, if
she's afraid we're all frumps," Anne suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it? But I think she stayed purposely.
Now, you&mdash;she says you're an exception;
that there can't be many like you.
You see, Madge has a standard of her own; she
says she'd be ashamed to go through college
the way some of the boys do, with just a good
time and as low marks as they can safely get.
She says she'd want to be a student if she pretended
to, and yet she must have a good time,
and&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>"And she thinks it can't be done? Dear me,
what an error! Well, if she'll come up I'll
be very glad to have her, I'm sure. I can trot
out our little pastimes and er&mdash;omit the more
<i>sociological</i> side," said Anne, with a grin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harte leaned forward eagerly. "Yes,
that's just what I mean! She got enough of
that from Georgiana. I want her to watch
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sport about on the lawn? Gambol through
the village? 'Make the picturesque little lake
echo with sweet girlish gayety,' as the newspaper
gentlemen say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," and Mrs. Harte patted
Anne's broad shoulder. "That's what I mean,
you silly child. Just let her see that there are
a few diversions!"</p>

<p>Miss Marjory Cunningham, who was just
then coming up from the lake, was a tall,
well-grown young woman of seventeen, with
a handsome, assured face and unexceptionable
garments. She looked fully twenty, and was
young enough to find satisfaction in this circumstance.
She had been brought up, in the
orthodox American fashion, to take a prominent
part in the household, particularly in the
entertainment of her mother's many guests;
and this, added to the fact that she happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
to be much cleverer than the young women
with whom her social lot had hitherto been
cast, inclined her to regard any one under
thirty with a patronage somewhat offensive,
if mild.</p>

<p>She dropped down beside Anne as her aunt
left the broad piazza, and smiled politely.</p>

<p>"Aunt Frank says you're going to-morrow,"
she remarked, adding a little curiously,
"Shall you be glad to get back?"</p>

<p>"East, you mean? Why, yes. You see I'm
a week late. They've started up the show
without me, so to speak, and naturally it's
rather hard for them to worry along. They
may have given me up and laid my new little
single room at Lucilla Bradford's feet, which
would more than trouble me."</p>

<p>"Do they allow you to come back whenever
you want to?"</p>

<p>Miss Cunningham's tone was that of an indulgent
aunt toward a pet nephew on his
Christmas holidays, and Anne's reply was
framed accordingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, easily! They only insist on our being
back for the Glee Club concert. They're just
bound up in that, you know. So we usually
make a point of it. I must say," she changed
her tone, "I'd like to hear Carol Sawyer's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
explanations to Miss Roberts! Carol has a
fine imagination, but she's used it so much
of late that she'll have to surpass herself this
time to make much impression on Robbie.
You see I have the great good fortune to possess
an accommodating relative: the Amiable
Parent is far from well, and asked me if
I'd wait a week till he could go on, and cheer
his last moments&mdash;smooth his pillow, as it
were. So, since I've never gone away early
once and only come back late twice before,
and once with an excuse, I thought I was safe
to stay. And I told him that, notwithstanding
the fact that I was languishing among dirt
courts and single-piece drivers and Saturday
hops and&mdash;<i>and</i> your noble family, I'd stick
it out a week longer. Said I to the Amiable
Parent:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"<i>My own convenience count as nil;</i></p>
<p><i>It is my duty, and I will!</i>"</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next morning, when Nan came down to
breakfast, pink under her tan and with that
air that she always carried of having just come
out of the tub, Marjory really regretted her going.
She mentioned to her aunt that she would
have liked to see more of her, and that if she
<i>did</i> go to New York in the spring she should
surely go up to Northampton. It was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
only because Miss Gillatt danced and golfed
and drove and played tennis so well that Marjory's
interest was for the first time roused in
a girl of her own age, nor because her clothes
were nice and her ways amusing; what struck
Miss Cunningham was her guest's entire absence
of surprise at what she utterly failed to
recognize as an unusual amount of interest on
Marjory's part.</p>

<p>"This is Marjory&mdash;how do you do, Marjory?"
she had said easily on their first meeting,
and she had never cared to learn that Marjory
intended her own "Miss Gillatt" for a lesson
to forward schoolgirls. And she had taken
Marjory's growing attentions quite as if she
were accustomed to have handsome young women
talk to her and row her about and give
her their photographs. When she had herself
mentioned looking Nan up in Northampton,
her proposition had not evoked the grateful
surprise that might have been expected.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you any time," the future
hostess had returned. "Better come up in the
spring; it's a lot prettier." And Madge had
decided then and there to go, though her suggestion
had been more or less perfunctory.</p>

<p>She would never have considered it for a
moment had it not been perfectly obvious that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
the college girl did not regard herself at all in
the light of a possible example. Georgiana's
lectures on the Higher Education of Women
and its Ultimate Effect on the Sex were not to
be thought of in connection with this athletic
damsel, whose quotations, though frequent,
indicated a closer study of Lewis Carroll and
W. S. Gilbert than her alma mater's official
catalogue would suggest. She referred very little
to the college and then only as the scene
of incidents in which she and her "young
friends," as she invariably called them, had
taken amusing or amazing parts. Marjory's
chief impression had been that of the jolliest
possible crowd of girls, who seemed to derive
great comfort and entertainment from one another's
company, and it was a half-envious
desire to see if they really did this to the extent
that Anne implied, that drew her to
Northampton one fine day in the late spring.</p>

<p>As she stood on the station platform looking
in vain for a tall girl with broad shoulders
and a persuasive grin, she heard her name
called, and turned to meet the outstretched
hand of a very different person. This person
was small and slender, with a plain, distinguished
little face, intelligent eyes, and a low
and charming voice. From the very Parisian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
arrangement that topped her shining coils of
hair to the tips of her tiny shoes, she was one
of the most thoroughly well-dressed young
women Marjory had ever seen. She reminded
one vaguely, though not disagreeably, of Mr.
Wenzell's pictures, and Marjory failed utterly
in a dazed attempt to correlate her and
Georgiana.</p>

<p>"You are Miss Cunningham, are you not?
I am Ursula Wyckoff. Nan is so sorry, but
Hodgkinson Davids or Davidson Hodgkins&mdash;I
can't remember the way&mdash;has come up
from New York to play over the course to-day,
and of course all the golf people have to
be out there. She and Caroline have been there
all the afternoon, and I'm to bring you out a
little later, when they serve the tea. Isn't it
dreadfully warm? Nan's next to Caroline and
Caroline holds the championship, so they're
naturally interested. I don't play at all. I was
so sorry to miss you at the house-party: we
all fell in love with your aunt. Oh, no, New
York, but I've lots of Western friends: you
know I've met your aunt before, in London.
We bought some Liberty things, and we
were staying at the same hotel, and they sent
us each other's parcels, so we got acquainted
picking them out. There was a lovely fan; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
said it was for her niece. Was it you? I dream
of that fan yet."</p>

<p>They walked slowly up the long street,
Ursula chatting easily, and Marjory wondering
how many of the girls they passed belonged
to the college. They paused before a druggist's
window, all Huyler's and violet soap,
and Ursula walked by a long, shining soda
fountain to a room in green and white, with
little tables and a great palm in the centre.
The tables were very nearly filled, and there
was a cheerful clatter of tall spoons and a businesslike
bustle of clerks with trays.</p>

<p>"This is Kingsley's," said Ursula, with a
comprehensive gesture. "Will you have a
chocolate ice?" While absorbing the inviting
and pernicious mixture, Miss Cunningham
looked about her with interest. In one corner
four girls with rumpled shirt-waists and dusty
golf stockings squabbled over scores, and illustrated
with spoons preferred methods of
driving and putting. Their voices rose above
the level prescribed for drawing-room conversation,
and they called each other strange
names. In another corner a tall, dark girl with
a grave expression talked steadily in a low
voice to her companion, a clever-looking creature,
whose bursts of laughter grew hysterical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
as the dignified one continued, with a perfectly
impersonal manner, to reduce her to positive
tears of mirth. To them Ursula bowed, and
the narrator, politely recognizing her, went on
with her remarks, to an accompaniment of gurgling
protest from her friend. Near them a
porcelain blonde, gowned in a wonderful pale
blue stuff with a great hat covered with curly
plumes, ate strawberry ices with a tailor-made
person clothed in white piqué, mystic, wonderful.
She was all stiffness and specklessness,
and she looked with undisguised scorn at the
clamoring athletes, a white leather card-case
in her hand. Near one window a gypsy-faced
child in a big pink sunbonnet imparted mighty
confidences to her friend, who shook two magnificent
auburn braids over her shoulders with
every chuckle.</p>

<p>"And I heard a knock at the door and of
course I thought it was Helen or some of the
girls, and I called to come in and, my dear,
<i>who</i> do you think it was? It was the <i>expressman</i>!
'Will you sign this book?' said he, and
he brought the book right up to the bed and
I leaned on my elbow and signed it! My dear,
wasn't that perfectly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it's awfully funny here, anyway.
That beastly old laundry tore my lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
lace nightgown to shreds and it was new, and
I put in an old dressing-sacque that was all
in rags and I was going to throw it away, and
they mended it carefully before they sent it
back!"</p>

<p>As they left the room and Ursula waited
while the clerk looked up her soda ticket, the
door flew open and an impish little creature,
with a large, deprecating, motherly girl in her
wake, slipped into the shop.</p>

<p>"Now don't make for the back room,
Bertie dear, for there isn't time. We've got
lots of places to do yet!" she called, and catching
sight of Ursula she dashed up to her.</p>

<p>"What do you think Alberta and I are doing?
We're <i>so</i> bored, and we're going to stop
at every drug store on this side and have an
ice-cream soda, and the same going back on
the other side. Isn't that interesting? I tell
Alberta it's bound to be&mdash;sooner or later!"</p>

<p>"Is that a freshman?" Marjory inquired
competently, and Ursula's eyes twinkled as
she replied gravely:</p>

<p>"No, that's a senior. She has fits of idiocy,
but in her better moments she's quite a person
to know. She's in the Lawrence with me.
Why on earth she should go and get Alberta
May and drag her into degradation and dyspepsia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
nobody knows, but she always does."</p>

<p>They rested for a while in Ursula's room,
which was "more than enormous," as Anne
said&mdash;it was intended for a double room&mdash;and
furnished very delightfully. There were
some beautiful Copley prints and a cast or two
and a long low shelf of books and fascinating
wicker chairs with puffy cushions. There was
the inevitable tea-table and chafing-dish paraphernalia
and the inevitable couch with a great
many Yale pillows; but there were not more
than a dozen photographs of girls in any one
place and only one Gibson girl, and she was
very small. There was a beautiful desk all littered
with papers and little photographs of
Ursula's family and her horse at home, and
a lot of the pretty little cluttering things one
picks up abroad. Marjory saw no girl with
such consistently fascinating clothes as Ursula's
during her visit, nor did she sit in any
room so charming as hers, the college girl being
a generation behind her brother in this regard;
but first impressions are strong, and
Ursula's silver brushes, her beautiful etching,
and the two wonderful rugs that nearly covered
her shining floor formed the stage setting for
all Marjory's subsequent imaginary dramas.</p>

<p>They went out to the links by trolley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
through the long quiet street, past pretty
lawns and pleasant houses, into the real country
of fields and scattered cottages. Marjory
learned how "the crowd" had vacationed together
more than once; how they were going
up to Carol Sawyer's place in Maine next summer
for "the time of their lives"; how, after
their Commencement obsequies, they were going
for two weeks to Nan at Sconset and live
in a house all by themselves, and then four of
them were going abroad together with Nan's
father&mdash;"the dearest thing in the world";
how Caroline was going to study medicine in
Germany and Lucilla Bradford was going to
be married and continue to illumine Boston,
and Ursula and her sister were going to stay
indefinitely in France or Italy with various
relatives.</p>

<p>They seemed to have a very intimate knowledge
of one another's affairs, Marjory decided,
as they got out at the links and strolled up to
the tiny club-house. A straggling crowd was
gradually melting away there: hot, dishevelled
girls with heavy bags, cool and fluffy girls with
tea-cups, men arguing in white flannels and
men conversing in frock coats. Important small
boys&mdash;professors' sons and their friends from
the town&mdash;caddied for the great man and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
followers, patronizing the urchins who ordinarily
amassed wealth from this employment,
and a crowd of interested golfers from the
town trailed about the holes, admiring, criticising,
and chattering. Here and there a crimson
coat shone out, some of the ladies tilted gay
parasols, white duck dotted the grass everywhere.
It was all very jolly and interesting, and
when Nan came up with a white-flannelled
youth and a cheerful if exhausted friend whom
she introduced as "one of my little mates&mdash;Caroline
Wilde," Marjory could have thought,
as she sipped her tea and learned the score, that
she was back on the links at home.</p>

<p>Caroline had learned much and Nan had
held a reverent conversation with the champion
and was basking in the recollection of it.
Marjory met an ardent golfer in marvellous
stockings, who was with difficulty restrained
from illustrating, by means of his empty cup
and the parasol his fellow-professor was guarding,
the very latest method of effecting a tremendous
drive from a bad spot in the course,
and his friend turned out to be a classmate of
her brother's; and so they started from Yale,
which is a very good conversational starting-point,
and their reminiscences attracted Ursula,
who, with an adoring little freshman&mdash;Ursula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
was never without a freshman&mdash;and
the Church and the Law wrangling pleasantly
over a lost ball, was holding her court in a near
corner. They drifted up, and the Church and
the Law were so amusing and well set up that
Marjory quite lost her heart to them and wished
they would come "West," as they persisted in
calling Chicago, remarking confidentially that
nothing seemed to upset a person from Chicago
so much as that!</p>

<p>They rode home with the Church and the
Law, while the assistant in that great undertaking,
the higher education of women, raced
the trolley on a Columbia Chainless, to the
wild delight of the passengers, who cheered
his futile efforts and bribed the motorman to
an exciting rate of speed.</p>

<p>"Do you have lessons with him, really?"
Marjory demanded, as they left the rapidly
churning golf stockings behind for the moment.
Nan grinned. "Do you, Ursula?" she
repeated. Ursula sighed but said nothing, and
Nan explained that in the midst of his artless
prattle last week he had mentioned a written
lesson in the near future, based upon certain
reference reading. "It comes off to-morrow,"
she added cheerfully, "and the young Lucilla
is hastily sprinting through the volumes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
and gathering information. She sought the
seclusion that a cabin grants last night, and
when I howled at her through the keyhole
that we were going to Boyden's for the evening
meal, she said that if she got through two
hundred pages and her notes by then she'd
be along. Ursula does it bit by bit, and then
tells us to go to the ant, thou sluggard, but
little Lucy thinks she knows him better than
we do, and she said he wouldn't do it. I told
her, go to, he would; I saw it in his eye. So
Caroline started to fill her fountain pen&mdash;she
calls it that from force of habit&mdash;but what
she really does is to fill the room, and what
drips over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's Lucilla!" said somebody, and
they got off the car and teased Lucilla&mdash;a
small, tired person with a prim little face and
beautiful manners&mdash;all the way down to Boyden's.
A striking, sulky-looking girl with a
stylish golf suit that made her look like the
costumers' plates of tailor-made athletic maidens,
was holding a table for them, and she
turned out to be Carol Sawyer. She was the
first girl of "the crowd" Marjory did not like.
Her voice was loud and her manner a little
overbearing; she wore too many rings and her
attitude toward the college was very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
from the harmless nonsense that in the case
of the other girls covered plenty of good work
and a real interest in it. She was evidently very
wealthy, and Marjory caught herself wondering
if that was why the others put up with her.
When they had half finished their supper&mdash;and
a very good little supper it was&mdash;a large
girl, almost too tall for a girl, in a mussy short
skirt and badly fitting shirt-waist sauntered
into the room. From their own table and most
of the others a chorus of welcome went up.</p>

<p>"Hello, Teddy!" "Don't hurry, Dody!"
"Come over here, Dodo!" "Theodora, dear
child, your side-comb is nearly out!" "Have
some berries, Ted?"</p>

<p>She included them all in a cheerful
"Hello!" and strolled up to Nan's table.
"This is little Theodora Bent," said Nan,
kindly. "She is very shy and unused to company,
but her heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her heart," little Theodora interrupted,
dragging a chair from somewhere and quietly
appropriating Ursula's creamed chicken, "is
not here. It is with our friend, Mrs. Austin,
who sits at a lonely table wondering where her
loved ones are to-night. I met her at the door.
'Dorothea,' said she&mdash;and why she persists
in calling me Dorothea we shall know, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
when the mists have cleared away&mdash;'Dorothea,
there is hardly a Friday night that
you girls are in to supper. I'm sure I can't
see why!' I said that it <i>was</i> strange, but it
just happened so. Then she insisted on knowing
why; so I suggested that perhaps you
found the noise in the dining-room trying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dodo! you didn't!"</p>

<p>"Certainly I did. I should suppose you
might. Anybody who sits near <i>you</i> certainly
does! And she said that some freshman or
other had been decorating the piazza all the
afternoon, lying in wait for me to tutor her,
and suggested that I ought to manage better.
And I told her I'd tutored three hours and
a half to-day and I had a written lesson and
Phi Kappa Farewell to-morrow night, and I
thought that if she didn't object to the freshman
I'd leave her there till next week. So I
left her standing in the door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>A thing she has never done before!</i>" sang
Nan, softly, and they laughed long and merrily,
as people laugh who are not very ancient,
and who have just had a good supper and are
the best of friends.</p>

<p>It was a little after that that the Glee Club
sang on the steps of Music Hall, while crowds
of girls streamed out and sat on the grass and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
wandered up and down or listened on dormitory
steps. They sang sweet songs and funny
songs, and the audience sitting on the campus
clapped and clapped again. Their repertoire
amazed Miss Cunningham, who had been
firmly impressed with the idea that <i>A Spanish
Cavalier</i> and <i>Aunt Dinah's Quilting Party</i> were
necessarily sung by the college girl to the exclusion
of all other melodies. She was used
to them now, used to pigtails and puffs, shirt-waists
and evening dresses, Western rolled r's
and Eastern broad a's, handsome matronly
young women, and slim, saucy little chits, solitary
walkers, devoted pairs, and rollicking
bands. The light faded imperceptibly, turning
the ugly brick to a soft pink, bringing out
the pale mingling of colors that spread over
the smooth, green campus, with here and
there a girl vivid in crimson or violet. The
leader raised her hand and they started a
medley, with queer changes and funny little
turns.</p>

<p>How happy they seemed, how well able to
amuse each other!</p>

<p>Then, as the faces on the steps grew indistinct
and the little night noises grew plainer,
just as the Club turned to go in somebody
called, "<i>Mandalay!</i>" The crowd took it up
and "<i>Mandalay!</i>" sounded from all the
groups. Three or four girls with guitars
turned up from somewhere, and a mandolin
was produced from the Hubbard; a tall, slender
girl stepped out a little from the rest and
turned upon the waiting audience the kind of
soft, rich voice that sounds rough and strained
indoors, but only a little thrilled and anxious
in the open air.</p>

<p>By the old Moulmein Pagoda, lookin' eastward to the sea,</p>
<p>There's a Burma girl a-settin' an' I know she thinks o' me!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the girls perched on balcony railings;
some leaned on each other's shoulders;
the strolling pairs and groups stopped, interlocked,
and listened as attentively as if they
did not already know it by heart; their white
dresses glimmered among the shrubbery. Ursula
and Theodora Bent, a strange pair, Marjory
thought, had dropped down on a bench,
the little graceful figure balanced on the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
of the seat with one arm over the broad shoulders
of her big, careless friend. Nan's merry
face took on the almost wistful look that music
always brought there, and Marjory wondered
if the silent, waiting group knew how soft their
eyes grew and how much alike they all looked
suddenly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>An' the dawn comes up like thunder out er China 'crost the Bay!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A moment of silence, a burst of applause,
and the crowd was scurrying away as if a bell
had struck. The chatter rose again, the faces
changed, and to crown the transformation a
tall, dark girl with a handsome face&mdash;the girl
they had seen at Kingsley's&mdash;rose languidly
from the top step of the Washburn and sang
with a startling imitation of the first singer,
to a group of girls about her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Oh, that Road to Mandalay!</p>
<p class="i2">Must we hear it night and day?</p>
<p>For the author'd swear like thunder if he heard it sung that way!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wild applause and a cry of, "Second verse,
Neal! second verse!" followed, and as they
walked past the Hatfield by a group of girls
audibly disapproving of the parody and its
singer, they caught the second verse:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>For they sing it ev'ry evening, and they sing it ev'ry morn;</p>
<p>They will sing it at my fun'ral&mdash;was it sung when I was born?</p>
<p>Just as soon as I reach heaven, and they teach me how to play,</p>
<p>Oh, I know the tune I learn on will be Road to Mandalay!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The juniors chuckled, and as Nan commended
the abilities of the cynical senior,
Marjory remembered her face as it had been
a few minutes before, and wondered.</p>

<p>They took her to her boarding-house and
left her to get to bed, for she was tired. And
in the morning she went, by previous arrangement,
to the Lawrence, whence Dody Bent took
her down to Boyden's to eggs and toast, and
coffee in a shining silvery pot, and said that in
consequence of the apparently unchanged intentions
of Dr. Robbins she should necessarily
be much engaged from ten until eleven
and the few scant minutes preceding those
hours, and that Misses Gillatt, Bradford, and
Wyckoff expected to be similarly occupied.
Caroline Wilde, however, who apparently did
little but work in the laboratory and keep
out-of-doors, would be charmed to row her
about Paradise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, at a few minutes after nine,
Marjory stood at the foot of the main staircase,
swaying backward and forward in the
chapel rush, and picked out Caroline, sauntering
down with a cheerful "Hello!" for everybody
on the stairs and that air of leisure that
was the despair and admiration of the perpetually
rushed; for she was one of the notoriously
busy people in the college&mdash;always "at
everything," distressingly competent in several
of the stiffest courses offered, the first aid
to the injured in any capacity, and the prop of
more committees than she had fingers. She
was always perfectly well and always wore a
shirt-waist, and she was one of the exceedingly
few people who are equally popular with students,
Faculty, and ladies-in-charge.</p>

<p>She pulled Marjory about in the most
scientific manner over a somewhat restricted
body of water boasting a great deal of scenery
for its size, conversing at length on basket-ball,
in which she had been twice defeated,
and not at all on golf and tennis, in which she
held the college championship. In the course
of her remarks it became apparent that Ursula
and Dodo formed one third of "their
crowd," she and Nan another third, and Lucilla
and Carol Sawyer one sixth each.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>Of Lucilla there seemed to be little to say:
she was of extensive ancestry and made the
best fudge in the place. She was also a good
person to tell things to and was always quiet
and polite. Dodo spoke&mdash;very literally&mdash;for
herself. She was one of the best actresses in the
college; she had some very bad quarter-hours
back of her continual nonsense; she was poor,
and there was something the matter all the
time at home. Ursula was one of the all 'round
girls of the college; she did beautiful work,
and wrote very well and knew a lot&mdash;and her
clothes! She dressed for the crowd. Nan was,
of course, the best girl in the world, as might
be seen by anybody with an eye in its head.</p>

<p>And Carol? Oh, Carol was all right. You
had to come to know her, that was all. People
didn't understand Carol. Her mother died
when she was a baby, and she didn't like
her Eastern aunt, who took care of her part
of the time. They were really ridiculously
wealthy, and her father was&mdash;well, her father
wasn't very attractive. She had lived a great
deal in San Francisco, and in the West girls
do very much more as they please, you know.
There wasn't a more generous girl on the face
of the earth. She was a mighty good friend to
her friends. People said she was being tutored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
through college. It wasn't so. And what if she
was? Look at the men! Her bark was worse
than her bite: she said more than she did. If
all the things she had done for people up here
were known&mdash;but she would be horribly angry
if they were.</p>

<p>It occurred to Marjory during that morning
and afterwards, as she was handed impartially
from one to the other of the six juniors
who constituted her entertainment committee,
that it was well to have five friends to
take care of your character with the world.</p>

<p>In the evening she went, by favor of Ursula
and Dodo, in the character of a distant relative,
to the entertainment proper of the Phi
Kappa Farewell, a play given to the seniors
of that honorable body by the juniors. Nothing
but a detailed account of the drama could
worthily treat of it, and that cannot be given.
It was a melodrama based on the Spanish
War, adapted from a blood-and-thunder novel
into a play of five acts with three and four
scenes to the act. A large cast presented it, comprising
revolutionists, Cubans, spies, U. S.
Army and Navy, native population, planters,
New York belles, and English nobility, and
there were slow deaths, ghastly conspiracies,
horribly pathetic separations, magnificent patriotic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
tableaux, and a final and startling adjustment
that exceeded in scenic display the
wildest expectation of the enraptured audience.</p>

<p>From the first act, in a Fifth Avenue parlor,
furnished with a toy piano perched on a
card-table and a Vision of Elegance accompanying,
with much execution and one finger,
a rival Vision who rendered <i>My bonnie lies over
the ocean</i> with dramatic fervor and a sob that
recalled Bernhardt, while Dodo, in irreproachable
evening dress and a curly mustache, devotedly
turned the half-inch sheet music, one
elbow ostentatiously leaned on the twelve-inch
piano; to the ecstatic <i>finale</i> in the Havana Cathedral,
where two marvellous brides in window-curtain-trained
wedding dresses, orange
blossoms, and indefinite yards of white mosquito
netting were led to the altar by a noble
naval officer and a haughty peer of the
realm, the entire cast in the character of bridal
party performing an elaborate ballet to the
Lohengrin March, the procession preceded by
a priest two-stepping solemnly at the head, it
was the most astonishingly, cleverly, unspeakably
idiotic performance Marjory had ever seen.
Revolvers went off, victims shrieked, dons
and doñas sneered, terrible shell-trimmed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
tawny-skinned natives leaped and brandished
and gabbled, virtue pleaded, and villainy cried
"Ha, ha!" and everybody called upon Heaven
except the peer of the realm, who very properly
called upon England. They rolled their
r's and smote their chests and spoke in a vibrating
contralto, while at the proper places
the audience groaned and clapped and hissed
and at the end fairly thundered its applause.</p>

<p>Nobody who had seen the two heroines under
a trusty Spanish escort travelling through
a mountain gorge, half of the escort placidly
dragging a ramping, double-breasted rocking-horse
cart, and the other half cavorting gracefully
about with a small mounted horse under
his arm, could ever forget the sight; nor the
languishing ladies in glorious Spanish costumes
tossing their trains behind and coquetting
with enormous fans as they conspired in
dramatic and deep-chested asides to the audience.</p>

<p>Ursula, Dodo, and another genius had
adapted this never-sufficiently-to-be-praised
work, and they appeared flushed and panting
from the wedding scene, to receive the ovation
prepared for them. Ursula said that to have
seen Martha Williams in undisguised hysteria
and B. S. Kitts and Susan Jackson collapsed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
in their chairs was honor enough for her, and
that she would willingly have worked twice
as hard as she did for it. Then they went over,
costumes and all, to the Dewey, to eat ices and
go home, for the play had occupied two hours
or more and such a strain was naturally somewhat
enervating, as Biscuits said.</p>

<p>They took breakfast next morning in Ursula's
room: strawberries and rich chocolate
and rolls and scrambled eggs. Lucilla cooked it
in two chafing-dishes, and Carol and Caroline
came over from the Morris to share it, Carol
in a magnificent fluffy party-cloak with a gorgeous
crêpe kimono under it, Dodo in a hideous
house-jacket, and Caroline in the inevitable
shirt-waist. Then Ursula went to church
in a heavenly lavender bâtiste and white-rabbit
gloves, as Nan called them; Lucilla accompanied
her in a demure little checked silk, and
Carol sulked in her room, wrapped in the
kimono.</p>

<p>Dodo wrote some difficult letters home,
and took a walk to get over them; Caroline
tramped out to Florence, where she conducted
a funny little Sunday-school&mdash;in a shirt-waist;
Marjory and Nan strolled out to Paradise and
talked. They dined in state with the house and
its guests on the traditional Sunday turkey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Nan speculating solemnly on the exhaustless
energy of Providence, except for whose ceaseless
intervention the race of turkeys must long
since have become extinct. Later they retired
to the parlor and sat on sofas while the after-dinner
Sunday music was performed&mdash;an
apparently mechanical process where the same
girls offered the same things to the same audience
with the same expression that they had
presented the Sunday before. The <i>Marche
Funèbre</i> received the usual sighs of pleasure,
an optimistic young lady rendered the love
song from <i>Samson et Dalila</i>, and at unmistakable
evidences of approaching <i>Mandalay</i> the
occupants of the sofa nearest the door murmured
something about letters and melted
away.</p>

<p>To vespers, referred to by the devout as
"the sweetest of the college services," entitled
by the profane "the Sunday strut," owing to
the toilets of the carefully selected ushers
and the general prevalence of millinery, Marjory
did not go, for returning from a walk
with Lucilla, they found Miss Gillatt pinching
the ears of a gentleman upon whose lap she
sat, whose not too abundant hair she had arranged
in peculiarly foolish spirals that bobbed
over his ears as he responded to the introduction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
"<i>Voilà le père aimable! Il est arrivé avec
un</i> box <i>énorme&mdash;c'est un enfant bien gentil, n'est-ce
pas? Nous en mangerons</i> to-morrow night, <i>mon
Dieu,</i> and for once <i>nous aurons quelqu' chose</i> fit
to eat&mdash;<i>hein? A moi, Lucille&mdash;il y aura une
chaleur excessive dans la ville ancienne ce soir!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Le père aimable</i> greeted Marjory with an
unfeigned interest, and when to his inquiring
"Cunningham? Cunningham? I don't remember
Cunningham, do I, Nannie?" Nan replied
easily, "Oh, no, she's not a regular inmate!"
Marjory felt suddenly left out and
undeserving, somehow, of all the joy in store.</p>

<p>It was worth being away from home to be
one of the four girls who hung upon the
Amiable Parent the next day as he wandered
happily through the campus, distributing Allegretti
and admiration as he went. He beamed
upon them all, annexing the pretty ones regardless
of expense, as his irreverent daughter
put it. He chartered a tally-ho, and they tooted
off to Chesterfield and broke the horn beyond
repair, convulsing him with laughter all
the way. Caroline cut her laboratory for it and
enjoyed it "with a serene and sickly suavity
known only to the truly virtuous," to use her
friends' quotation; Dodo was a continuous
performance all the way; and at Chesterfield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
they ate till there was little left in the village,
as it had not been sufficiently forewarned of
their invasion.</p>

<p>They got back in time to dress, and here
Marjory's ideas sustained a distinct shock.
She had always perfectly understood from the
fiction devoted to such descriptions that it was
the custom of young ladies at boarding-schools
and colleges, when they wished to be peculiarly
uproarious and sinful, to gather in carefully
darkened apartments, robed in blanket-wrappers
and nightgowns, with braided or dishevelled
hair, in order to eat olives and pickles
with hat-pins from the bottles, toasting marshmallows
at intervals, and discussing the suitability
of cribs and the essential qualities of
really earnest friendships. But the consumption
of the "box <i>énorme</i>" was differently organized.
If she hadn't brought any evening
dress it didn't matter, Nan assured her, but
they considered the event more than worthy
of it, though it wasn't an occasion for a Prom
costume by any means.</p>

<p>All the way down the corridor she smelled
it, that night at seven. It was necessarily far
from private&mdash;envious upper-class girls not
invited sniffed it from afar, and the three little
freshmen who waited on them glowed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
pride and anticipation. It was in Ursula's
room, for Nan's was too small and the guests
used it for a cloak-room. Mrs. Austin greeted
her cordially at the door, and Marjory, who
had always supposed that those in authority
were constitutionally opposed to spreads, could
not realize that her wreathèd smiles were genuine.
She did not know that the Amiable
Parent had dutifully called upon Mrs. Austin
in all good form, openly discussed the spread,
and cannily presented the lady with a fascinating
box of Canton ginger-buds&mdash;ginger
being the Amiable Parent's professional interest.</p>

<p>When they were assembled, a baker's dozen
of them, the Amiable Parent grinning, as his
dutiful daughter expressed it, like a Cheshire
cat over his capacious shirt-front, Marjory
made their acquaintance over again from the
evening-dress standpoint. Against the dark
furniture and bookbindings their shoulders
shone soft and white; their hair was piled high;
they looked two or three years older. Ursula
in pink taffeta, with coral in her glossy dark
coils, was a veritable <i>marquise</i>; Nan in white
with lavender ribbons, and a pale amethyst
against her throat, was transformed from a
jolly, active girl to a handsome young woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
with charmingly correct shoulders; Caroline
was almost pretty; Lucilla's small prim head
was set on the most beautiful tapering little
neck in the world. Only Dodo in an organdie
many times laundered was the same as ever,
bony, awkward, and the greatest fun possible;
while Carol's strange half-sullen face looked
more impassive than ever under her heavy
turquoise fillet.</p>

<p>The freshmen, shy but delighted, passed
them "food after food," as Dodo called it: cold
roast chicken, lobster salad on crisp, curly
lettuce, delicious thin, little bread-and-butter
sandwiches with the crusts off, devilled eggs,
stuffed olives, almonds and ginger. There was
a great sheet of fudge-cake, which is a two-storied
arrangement of solid chocolate cake
with a thick fudge filling and a half-inch icing,
a compound possible of safe consumption to
girls and ostriches only. There were dozens and
dozens of a fascinating kind of thin wafer filled
with nuts, and there were plates of chocolate
peppermints. Also there were many bottles of
imported ginger ale, which the freshmen presented
in graceful, curved glasses after the Amiable
Parent had with much chuckling pulled
the corks, the freshmen pitching these last
cheerfully down the corridor at their friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
who came to scoff but went away to pray. That
immediate amalgamation with the class of her
hostesses which always occurs to guests made
Marjory regard the pretty waitresses with upper-class
patronage, till it occurred to her that
they might be older than she, and that after
all....</p>

<p>One in especial, whom the Amiable Parent
insisted on feeding from his own plate, was
very pretty and apparently very popular. But
why the brown-eyed, red-cheeked adorer of
Ursula should be <i>Theo</i> Root, while Miss Bent
was always <i>Dodo</i>; why Alida Fosdick was <i>Dick</i>,
but Serena Burdick was Serena; why Elizabeth
Twitchell was <i>Twitchie</i>, but Elizabeth
Mitchell was <i>Betty</i>; why Ursula was always
Ursula, and Nan was often <i>Jack</i> and sometimes
<i>Pip</i> (it was because <i>Captain Gadsby</i> was
one of her famous parts) Marjory could not tell.</p>

<p>When they were through and not another
of all those two pounds of almonds could be
eaten, and the freshmen had carried off the
remains to dispose of them in the most obvious
and economical manner, they proceeded
to "do stunts," to the boundless joy of the
Amiable Parent. Dick Fosdick, a plain, heavy-eyed
senior, arose, draped in a black cashmere
shawl, and delivered a lecture on the suffrage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
in a manner to cause one to pinch oneself to
make sure it was not a dream and she was not
forty-five and horrible. The Amiable Parent
choked to suffocation, vowed she was the
cleverest actress this side the water, and called
for the next. Dodo, with lifted skirts and utterly
unmoved features, jumping up heavily
and landing on both feet with turned-in toes&mdash;she
followed the good old custom of tan
walking-boots with evening dress&mdash;droned in
a monotonous nasal chant, to which her thudding
feet kept time, an unholy song of no tune
whatever:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, it's <i>dance</i> like a <i>fairy</i> and <i>sing</i> like a <i>bird</i>,</p>
<p class="i5">And <i>sing</i> like a <i>bird</i>,</p>
<p class="i5">And <i>sing</i> like a <i>bird</i>,</p>
<p>It's <i>dance</i> like a <i>fairy</i> and <i>sing</i> like a <i>bird</i>,</p>
<p class="i6"><i>Sing</i> like a <i>bird</i> in <i>June</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Anybody who has not seen this done by a
solemn-looking girl of five feet seven or so,
who divests a naturally humorous mouth of
any expression whatever, and lands on the
floor like an inspired steam-roller, is not in a
position to judge of the comic quality of the
performance.</p>

<p>Nan, with much coy reluctance and very
Gallic gestures, rendered what was pessimistically
called her "naughty little French song."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Its burden was not discoverably pernicious,
however, consisting of the question, "<i>O Jean
Baptiste, pourquoi?</i>" occasionally varied by the
rapturous answer, "<i>O Jean Baptiste, voilà!</i>"
But there was accent enough to make anything
naughty, and she looked so pretty they
made her do it again.</p>

<p>Lucilla resisted many appeals, but succumbed
finally to the Amiable Parent, who
could wheedle the gate off its hinges, according
to his daughter, and delivered her "one
and only stunt." She had performed it steadily
since freshman year, always with the same wild
success, never with a hint of its palling. Marjory
wondered why they laughed so&mdash;they
all knew it by heart&mdash;and asked if anybody
else never did it; their amazed negative impressed
her greatly. She stood before them
slim and straight, this daughter of a hundred
Bostonians, a little cold, a little bored, a little
displeased, apparently, and with an utterly
emotionless voice and a quite impersonal manner
delivered the most senseless doggerel in
the most delicately precise enunciation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Baby sat on the window ledge,</p>
<p>Mary pushed her over the edge.</p>
<p>Baby broke into bits so airy&mdash;</p>
<p>Mother shook her finger at Mary.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Sarah poisoned mother's tea,</p>
<p>Mother died in agonee.</p>
<p>Father looked quite sad and vexed&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Sarah, my child,</i>" he said, "<i>what next?</i>"</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>Any one to whom this seems a futile and
non-humorous piece of verse needs only to
hear Lucilla's delivery of it, and catch the
almost imperceptible shade of displeasure and
surprise that touched her slender eyebrows at
the last line, to realize that all similar exhibitions
must seem forever crude beside it.</p>

<p>They begged Marjory to sing and got her
a guitar. As it had slowly dawned on her that
most of the girls in the room played something,
and that at least one third of them belonged
to one or another of the musical clubs
besides the many other organizations they
carried, and thought nothing whatever of it&mdash;or
concealed it if they did&mdash;her estimate of
a hitherto much prized accomplishment had
steadily decreased. She sang a little serenade
for them, however, more tremulously than she
had been wont to sing for a crowd of young
people, and took an unreasoning and disproportionate
amount of pleasure in their hearty
applause. She sang again, and when Miss Cornelia
Burt, who turned out to be the dark girl
she had watched at Kingsley's and recognized,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
thanked her particularly and told her with a
smile that she should "come up" and sing
that with the Glee Club, Marjory remembered
that she was a prominent senior, and found
her heart beating a little faster when her friend
Miss Twitchell, also prominent, repeated the
suggestion. It could not be, she asked herself
a moment afterwards, that <i>she</i> was proud to
have them notice her?</p>

<p>There were more stunts, for the Amiable
Parent could not have enough of what Nan
called Dodo's Anglo-Saxon attitudes. Only
the bell brought a stop to the proceedings,
which had grown more and more hilarious,
ending with a toast in ginger ale, to the delighted
hero of the feast:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> to Nannie's <i>Dad</i>, drink him <i>down</i>!</p>
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> to Nannie's <i>Dad</i>, drink him <i>down</i>!</p>
<p class="i5">Oh, <i>here's</i> to Nannie's <i>Dad</i>,</p>
<p class="i5">He's the <i>best</i> she could have <i>had</i>,</p>
<p>Drink him <i>down</i>, drink him <i>down</i>, drink him <i>down</i>, down, <i>down</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nan and he and Marjory went out into the
cool, dark campus, and they marched to "Balm
of Gilead" all the way to Marjory's boarding-house.
She watched them from her window,
tramping arm-in-arm down to the hotel, where
Nan was to stay the night with him. Nan had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
explained that while of course it would be a
trial to her to be obliged to select her own
breakfast, still her relative had desired it, and
she had as usual bidden him "her own convenience
count as nil."</p>

<p>Marjory undressed slowly, humming the
tune they had marched to and surveying the
plain boarding-house bed-room. It seemed
lonely after the Lawrence, and there was no
dashing about in the halls, nor glimpses of
fudge-parties and rarebits and laughing, busy
people through half-shut doors.</p>

<p>"Still, that Miss Burt was off the campus,"
she murmured as she braided her hair; and
as she set the alarm-clock somebody had
loaned her&mdash;for she took an early train&mdash;and
climbed into bed, she explained to an
imaginary aunt that people on the temporary
list with no campus application whatever often

<p class="stories">VIII<br />

THE EVOLUTION OF EVANGELINE</p>

<p>To those who knew her afterward it
may seem an impossible condition
of affairs, but it is nevertheless quite
true that until the night of the sophomore
reception she was utterly unheard of.
Indeed, when her name was read to the chairman
of the committee that looks up stray
freshmen, yet uninvited, and compels them
to come in, the chairman refused to believe
that she existed.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's any such person,"
she growled, "and if there is, there's nobody
to take her. I can't <i>make</i> sophomores! Evangeline
Potts, forsooth! What a perfectly idiotic
name! Who's to take her? Where does she
live? Where's the catalogue?"</p>

<p>"She lives on West Street," somebody volunteered,
"and Bertha Kitts' freshman is sick,
or her uncle is sick, or something, and Bertha
says that lets <i>her</i> out&mdash;she never wanted to go,
anyhow&mdash;and now she's not going. Couldn't
she take her?"</p>

<p>"Not going!" the chairman complained
bitterly. "If that's not like B. Kitts! Go get
her, somebody, and send her after Evangeline,
and tell her to hurry, too! Don't stop to argue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
with her, there isn't time. She'll prove that
there isn't any reception, if you let her. Just
get her started and then come right back. I
promised to send three Bagdads over, and I
can't get but two."</p>

<p>The messenger paused at Miss Kitts' door,
sniffed scornfully at the sign which read:
"Asleep! Please do not disturb under any circumstances
whatever!" and entered the room
abruptly. Miss Kitts was curled comfortably
on the window-seat, with <i>Plain Tales from the
Hills</i> in one hand, and <i>The Works of Christopher
Marlowe</i> in the other. From these volumes
she read alternately, and the pile of cores
and seeds on the sill indicated a due regard for
other than mental nutriment. At intervals she
lifted her eyes from her book to watch the file
of girls loaded down with the pillows, screens,
and palms whose transportation forms so considerable
a portion of the higher education of
women. Just as the door opened Biscuits was
chuckling gently at the collision of a rubber-plant
with a Japanese screen and the consequent
collapse of their respective bearers, who,
even in their downfall, poured forth the apologies
and regrets that take the place of their
brothers' less considerate remarks upon similar
occasions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>But her mirth was rudely checked by the
messenger, who closed the Marlowe and put
the Kipling under a pillow.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," she remarked briefly, "and
find Evangeline Potts and tell her that you
can't sleep at night till you take her to the
sophomore reception. Nobody urged her to
attend and yours is sick."</p>

<p>"She's not, either," returned B. Kitts,
calmly. "She's quite well, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't possum, Biscuits, but get along.
Sue's nearly wild. It's her uncle, then; we
know you weren't going, so we know you can
take her. Can I take this couch cover along?
She's on West Street, and I can't stop to discuss
it, but we depend on you. Now <i>do</i> hurry
up; it's three already."</p>

<p>Biscuits freed her mind to the heap of pillows
in the middle of the floor, for there was
no one else to hear her. Then, still grumbling,
she put on her golf cape and walked over to
West Street. In a pessimistic frame of mind
she selected the most unattractive house, and
on inquiring if Miss Evangeline Potts lived
there and ascertaining that she did, she astonished
the slatternly maid by a heartfelt ejaculation
of "Sherlock Holmes!"&mdash;adding, with
resignation, "Is she in?" She was in, and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
guest climbed two flights of stairs and knocked
at her door.</p>

<p>Although Evangeline Potts was not fully
dressed and her room in consequent disorder,
she did not appear at all embarrassed, but finished
buttoning her shirt-waist and attached
her collar with calm deliberation. She was a
large, tall girl, with masses of auburn hair
strained back unbecomingly from a very freckled
face and heaped in tight coils on the top
of her head. Her eyes were a rich red-brown;
they struck you as lovely at first, till after a
while you discovered that they were like glass
or running water, always the same and absolutely
expressionless. She had large hands and
feet and a wide, slow smile, and she was dressed
in unmitigatedly bad taste, with sleeves two
years behind the style and a skirt that could
have had nothing to do with it at any date.</p>

<p>"I came to&mdash;to see if you had been&mdash;if
you were going to the sophomore reception,"
said Biscuits. "I'm Miss Kitts, Ninety-red,
and&mdash;and I've nobody to go with me and&mdash;and
I shall be glad&mdash;"</p>

<p>Biscuits was frankly embarrassed. She was
a clever girl, and clever girls of her age are
invariably conscious and more or less sensitive.
She knew how she would have felt if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
had been a freshman and a "left over": she
would have resented such an eleventh-hour
invitation and shown it, possibly. But if Evangeline
Potts bore any resentment it was not
apparent.</p>

<p>"No," she said quietly, "I haven't been
asked and I'd just as lieve go with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's very nice!" returned Biscuits,
cheerfully, "then that's settled. And what
color is your gown? I should like to send
you some flowers."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure what I <i>will</i> wear," said
Evangeline; "what will you?"</p>

<p>"My dress is pink," and Biscuits carefully
kept her surprise out of the answer. Miss
Potts did not look like the kind of girl to
possess more than one evening gown.</p>

<p>"How is it made?" Evangeline pursued.
She was not curious, and yet she was not talking
vaguely to cover any embarrassment: she
merely desired information.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's quite plain," and Biscuits rose to
go; she was a little bored and there was nothing
in Miss Potts' room to give any clew to
her apparently pointless character. Biscuits
prided herself on her ability to get at people
through their belongings, and graded her
friends as possessors of Baby Stuart, the Barye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Lion, a Botticelli Madonna, or the imp of
Lincoln Cathedral.</p>

<p>But Evangeline did not rise. "I mean, is
it low neck and short sleeves?" she insisted;
and as Biscuits nodded, she added, "Does
everybody wear them?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Biscuits, hastily; and then,
"That is, a great many do. It's not at all necessary,
though: you'll see plenty of girls without.
Any light organdie will do perfectly."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll go, then," remarked
Evangeline, calmly; "my dress wouldn't do."</p>

<p>She was not in the least apologetic or pathetic
or vexed: she merely stated a fact, and
it occurred to Biscuits, who was somewhat
susceptible to personality, that she meant precisely
what she said. Although absence from
the reception was just what Biscuits had previously
planned, she did not care to please
herself at this price, and though Evangeline
Potts was the last person she would have selected
for her companion, and visions of the
pretty little freshman she had had in mind on
filling out her programme flashed before her
with irritating clearness, she smiled encouragement
and remonstrated cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Why, anything will do, I
tell you! You don't need evening dress! One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
of my friends last year had all her clothes
ruined by a pipe or something that burst in
the closet and she went in white duck. And
she was one of the best-dressed girls in the
class, really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm not," interrupted Evangeline,
"and that's different. I'm just as much
obliged to you for asking me, Miss Kitts, but
I haven't any evening dress and I shouldn't
go without one."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Biscuits that she attempted
no further argument. She knew that
Evangeline Potts would not go unless she had
an evening dress, and it seemed, somehow,
imperative that she should go. She realized,
too, that borrowing was out of the question.</p>

<p>"Why don't you cut one of your dresses
out?" she suggested after a moment. "Suzanne
Endicott did that once when she was
unexpectedly asked to a dance and hadn't any
low waist with her."</p>

<p>"I can't sew," Evangeline replied, "and I
shouldn't know how to cut it."</p>

<p>In proportion as she seemed convinced of
the impossibility of going, Biscuits waxed
more eager to change her determination.</p>

<p>"See here," she said suddenly, "if I get
Suzanne over here, will you let <i>her</i> cut one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
your dresses out? I think she would; she's
awfully clever about that sort of thing and
she's very obliging, sometimes."</p>

<p>She was prepared for any answer but the
one forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't care," said Evangeline, indifferently,
"only she'd better hurry, hadn't
she?"</p>

<p>Biscuits was by now so impressed with the
vital necessity of getting Suzanne that she had
hardly time to wonder at her haste or her nervous
fear that the young lady might not be at
home. She trudged up the two flights and
sighed with relief at the sound of Suzanne's
mandolin. Miss Endicott was not fond of the
mandolin and played it solely for the purpose
of annoying the senior next door, who had a
nasty habit of rising early to study, and making
her bed violently, driving it into the wall
just opposite Suzanne's pillow. When remonstrated
with she returned with calmness that
she had not been accustomed, when herself a
sophomore, to object to the habits of seniors,
and that excitable young people who came to
college for heaven knew what, had better acquaint
themselves with habits of study in
others, since that was their only probable
source of knowledge of such habits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>Henceforth it became at once Suzanne's
duty and pleasure to give what she modestly
called "little recitals from time to time," accompanied
by her mandolin, which instrument
maddened her neighbor beyond endurance.
As Biscuits entered she was giving a
very dramatic rendering of the Jewel Song
from Faust, and to her guest's opening remarks
she replied only by a melodious burst
of laughter and the arch assurance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"<i>Non, non! Ce n'est plus toi!</i></p>
<p><i>Ce n'est plus ton visage!</i>"</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Biscuits obeyed an imperative gesture and
held her peace till the song was over, when the
performer, with an inimitable grin at the wall,
laid down her mandolin and pointed to a chair.</p>

<p>"<i>Que voulez-vous, ma plus chère? Vous avez
l'air&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake talk English, Suzanne!
I want you to come over and cut out
Evangeline Potts' evening dress. Will you?
She's freckled and big, and she won't go unless
you do. She's got to go, too. We can't
leave anybody out. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mais qu'avez-vous donc, ma chère Berthe?
Est-ce que j'suis couturière, moi?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Biscuits, obstinately, "you are,
and you know it. You might be able to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
her look like something. She's a perfect stick
now."</p>

<p>Suzanne shot one of her elfish glances at her
visitor. It was impossible to know what she
would do.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais certainement vous avez assez de joue,
vous!</i>" she suggested. Biscuits did not reply,
but watched the clock on the desk.</p>

<p>Suzanne shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien!</i>" she said cheerfully, "<i>me voilà
sage, Petits-pains, sage et bien aimable! Où demeure-t-elle
donc, votre amie?</i>"</p>

<p>"Bless you, Suzanne, her name's Evangeline
Potts! and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Evangeline Potts! <i>Mais quelle
horreur! Est-ce que je saurais prononcer ce nom
affreux?</i>" babbled Suzanne, while Biscuits
found her golf cape and hustled her out of
the door. Those who relied too long or too
securely on Miss Endicott's moods were frequently
disappointed in the end.</p>

<p>She had been born in San Francisco and
brought up, alternately, in Paris and New
York, by her brother, a rising young artist,
whose views were as broad as his handling, and
whose regret at parting with her was equalled
only by his firm determination to fulfil the
promise he had made their mother, long dead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
to educate her properly. Only his solemn assurance
that she should come back every summer
if she would behave, and finally conduct
their joint establishment in Paris with the Angora
for chaperon and the silky Skye for butler,
kept her from taking the first steamer back
from the seaport nearest the town she had
hated consistently since she left that scene of
delicious little suppers and jolly painter-people
and nights at the play and ecstatic exhibitions
when Brother was "on the line."</p>

<p>Now a wealthy young woman from San
Francisco who chooses to spend from two
to four years at an Eastern college is a sufficiently
complicated type in herself; when she
has grown up in studios and done very much
as she pleases all her life, she affords even
more food for thought to the student of character.</p>

<p>People who disliked Suzanne called her unprincipled
and shallow and lazy; people who
admired her called her brilliant and irresponsible
and lazy; people who loved her called her
fascinating and spoiled and lazy. She could
dance like a leaf in the wind; she could make
herself the most bewitching garments out of
nothing to speak of; she could create a Japanese
tea-room with one parasol and two fans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
and make a Persian interior from a rug, an
inlaid table, and a jewelled lantern; she could
learn anything perfectly in half the time it
would take anybody else to get a fair idea of
it, and she could, if so minded, carry insolence
to the point of a fine art. She was far from
pretty, but her clever little brown face, with
its strange gray eyes, compelled attention, and
her hair had that rare silvery tinge that is an
individuality in itself. She was never without
two or three devoted admirers, but her class
disliked her, and it took all their self-control
to bear with her to the extent that was necessary
in order to profit by her special abilities.
She was no more to be depended upon than
a kitten, and her periodical bursts of rage rendered
her unendurable to that large majority
which objects to flaming eyes and torrents of
assorted abuse, to say nothing of the occasional
destruction of bric-a-brac.</p>

<p>And yet, to the wonder of these righteous
critics, Suzanne kept her warm friends. There
was always some amiable Philistine to watch
her erratic movements with delighted awe, to
run on her errands, to listen to her amazing
confidences, and to stand up for her through
thick and thin. Though Biscuits and her little
circle were, even in their sophomore year, beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
to draw away from her, vaguely conscious
of a necessary parting of the ways,
frankly puzzled at the vagaries of this girl who
was half a spoiled baby, half a woman of the
world, at intervals the fascination of her personality
drew them back for a while, and they
wondered that they could have thought her
irresponsible and selfish at heart.</p>

<p>To-day, as Biscuits walked beside her, convulsed
by her narration of a recent tussle with
the lady-in-charge&mdash;"I was only putting an
accordion-pleated crêpe-paper frieze above the
moulding, with thumb tacks, and if she had
kept out of the way&mdash;pig! 'What do you
think you came to college for, Suzanne? Certainly
not work of this sort!' 'Oh, no, Mrs.
Wylie, of course not. I have long realized that
our real object in coming here was to save the
maids trouble!'"&mdash;she almost forgave her that
curt refusal to have anything to do with the
reception decorations: "You'd far better save
me for the Prom&mdash;I'll manage that, but I
won't do both, <i>vous savez, c'est un peu trop
fort</i>!" she had remarked royally, and the committee
had smothered their wrath and agreed,
and cursed her afterwards in detail, after the
manner of practical young women who are far
from the short-sightedness of allowing their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
emotions to interfere with their intentions.
Also, they do not enjoy giving needless pain&mdash;on
the spot. This is one of the sweetest attributes
of woman.</p>

<p>They knocked at Evangeline's door, and
omitting preliminary ceremonies, demanded
the dress. Evangeline produced a dark red
cashmere: Suzanne shook her head. A much
washed white lawn with what appeared to be
blue palm-leaf fans scattered over it was next
offered for consideration: Suzanne gasped,
"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" A gray gingham decorated with
yellow spirals met her demand for "a summer
thing," and caused the artist to sink upon the
floor with a tragic groan.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais, Evangéline, vous me serrez le c&oelig;ur!
C'est horrible! C'est effrayant!</i>"</p>

<p>Evangeline smiled politely but offered no
further suggestion.</p>

<p>Suzanne looked at her searchingly through
half-closed eyes. "Have you anything black?"
she demanded.</p>

<p>"I have a black silk," said Evangeline, and
she brought out a heavy, corded, ribbon-trimmed
affair with a pointed vest that would
have been highly suitable for a maiden aunt
who had, as Suzanne remarked, seen misfortune.
Biscuits sighed, but Suzanne rose rapidly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to her feet and clutched the scissors she had
brought with her.</p>

<p>"<i>Enfin! Ça y est!</i>" she cried. "Put it on
her, Biscuits!"</p>

<p>She persisted in utterly ignoring Evangeline,
or, more exactly, in treating her as if she
had been a doll, talking to her in a pitying
tone that required no answer and commenting
upon her deficiencies in a manner that
made Biscuits squirm visibly and glance apologetically
at the object of such impersonal criticism.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Potts doesn't care to have
such a&mdash;such a nice dress cut," she suggested,
as Suzanne, with what seemed a perfectly careless
gesture, slashed at the sleeves.</p>

<p>"<i>Quel malheur!</i>" replied the artist, indifferently,
and Evangeline added, "I'd just as
lieve."</p>

<p>With pursed lips Suzanne snipped and
pinched, while Biscuits followed her every
motion and Evangeline silently adjusted herself
to each new position as Suzanne pulled
and pushed her arms and neck about. At
length with a sudden motion Suzanne stripped
off the detached sleeves as if they had been
gloves, and snatched away the top of the scant
middle-aged waist with a quick movement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
"<i>Voilà!</i>" she said, and Biscuits gasped: for
Evangeline Potts was a transformed creature.
Her arms and neck were ivory white and as
soft and smooth as satin; the lovely curves of
her throat and shoulders could never have
been guessed at under the stiff black seams
of the waist.</p>

<p>Suzanne patted her arms appreciatively. "I
might have known it, with that hair and those
freckles!" she murmured. Then, calmly, to
Evangeline: "The trouble with your kind is,
you never have any eyebrows and your eyelids
get red, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p>She went a few steps back from the motionless
figure and stood silent.</p>

<p>"You could twist a black scarf," suggested
Biscuits, hastily. Suzanne waved her hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Tu me dégoûtes, à la fin!</i>" she said coldly;
"Get your cape on!" Then, to Evangeline:
"Undo your hair!" As the thick coil tumbled
over her shoulders, the directress of ceremonies
deliberately selected a light inner tress
and snipped it off.</p>

<p>"Take it down town and match it&mdash;in velvet
if you can, in silk if you can't," she commanded.
"And get enough, get two, three
yards!"</p>

<p>"But will Miss Potts want to spend&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Biscuits looked doubtfully at the white-armed
goddess who contemplated herself quietly in
the glass. It was impossible to know what she
was thinking; she was apparently quite accustomed
to strangers who dressed her in low-cut
evening dresses and snipped her hair and
spent her money.</p>

<p>Suzanne stamped her foot. "<i>Va-t-en!</i>" she
cried, and then, with an irresistible mimicry
of Evangeline, "<i>She'd</i> just as lieve!"</p>

<p>When Biscuits returned with a great strip
of tawny velvet, it was taken from her at the
door, and she was instructed to get from Suzanne's
room her make-up box and the gold
powder that had so unaccountably disappeared
after the play last week.</p>

<p>"They borrowed the eyebrow pencil and
that, the night of the dress rehearsal, and they
<i>swore</i> to bring them back&mdash;beasts! What
have I to call my own? <i>Rien!</i> Never, never,
never will I lend anything again! <i>Il faut faire
un fin, vraiment!</i>"</p>

<p>It was a long hunt for Biscuits, and more
than once it occurred to her that she had refused
to go on the decorating committee with
a view to escaping just such wearisome trotting
about. When she handed the box to Suzanne
and suggested that the result should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
extremely pleasing to justify such toil, the red
spot in the artist's either cheek and her wide-opened
eyes indicated the happy absorption
to which no effort seems worthy of mention.
Biscuits, not allowed to enter the room, sat
wearily on the stairs, longing to go home but
unwilling to abandon Suzanne. It was very
nearly six, and she was not dressed; she had
left the necessary perusal of <i>The Works of
Christopher Marlowe</i> till late in the day, thinking
to devote the evening to it; she took little
interest in Evangeline Potts, and she did not
care much for dancing.</p>

<p>But for the moment her resentment vanished
when Suzanne called her in and she beheld
the object of her labors under the gaslight
in a carefully darkened room. Her milk-white
shoulders rose magnificently from folds of
auburn velvet that her wonderful hair repeated
in loose waves about her face and a
great mass low on her neck. Her long, round
arms gleamed against the black of her skirt
and melted into the glow of her velvet girdle.
In the white light her freckles paled and her
eyes turned wholly brown, and said mysterious
things that could never by any possibility
have occurred to her.</p>

<p>"<i>Tiens! J'ai eu la main heureuse, n'est-ce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
pas? Vous la trouvez charmante?</i>" said Suzanne,
turning her about as if she had been
a dummy and indicating her opinion that the
back view was, if anything, more satisfying
than the front.</p>

<p>"You're a genius, Suzanne! She's simply
stunning! How did you do it?"</p>

<p>Suzanne smiled. "<i>C'est pas grand' chose</i>," she
said modestly. But she looked contentedly
at Evangeline and loosened her hair a little.
"Now remember, don't put on those hideous
rings," she commanded, "and don't wear anything
on your head. Do you dance well?"
she added.</p>

<p>Evangeline hesitated. "I dance a little,"
she replied, "pretty well, I guess."</p>

<p>Suzanne promptly encircled her waist and
whistled a waltz. After a few turns she stopped.</p>

<p>"You dance very badly," she said encouragingly.
"If I were you, I'd sit out most of
them. You can say it bores you&mdash;they'll be
glad enough. Besides, you might get red and
then you'd not be pretty. Now don't move
about much, and when Miss Kitts brings you
the white roses put them just where I told
you.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Evangeline, and as the
other two prepared to go she gave them one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
of her long, slow smiles. "I'm much obliged
to you both, I'm sure," she said; "you've
been very kind."</p>

<p>"<i>Adieu, mon enfant&mdash;à plus tard!</i>" and Suzanne
seized the door knob. She turned in
the door and threw a quick, piercing look
at her handiwork. "If you take my advice,
you'll never put on that dreadful shirt-waist
again, <i>très chère</i>," she said lightly. "You'll
spoil all this splendor, if you do. Give it
away&mdash;or, no, don't! you'd corrupt the taste
of the poor&mdash;burn it up, and the others with
it, and get a black suit and a black silk waist
and wear a big white tie, if you like. And a
white tam&mdash;one of those pussy ones. Wear
one color&mdash;<i>c'est plus distingué</i>&mdash;and if you
want a big black hat with plumes, I'll make
it for you. <i>Et maintenant, regarde-toi dans la
glace!</i>"</p>

<p>With this invocation they left her, and Biscuits,
learning that Suzanne had exhausted
her energy and proposed to inform her freshman
that she was ill and unable to attend the
reception, became possessed by the idea that
she was responsible for this particular illustration
of the artistic temperament, and went
without her dinner to hunt up a substitute.
She wasted no time in argument with Suzanne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
who lay luxuriously on her couch pillows with
her hands under her head, and planned costumes
for Evangeline Potts all the evening,
but tramped angrily over the campus till quarter
of seven to find an unattached sophomore,
forgetting that Evangeline's flowers were yet
to be purchased. Coming up with them in her
hand, a little later, she was forced to stop and
explain to the substitute the intricacies of Suzanne's
programme, breaking off abruptly to
beat her breast like the wedding guest, for she
heard the loud bassoon and fled to her room,
tearing her evening dress hopelessly and completing
her toilette on the stairs. The substitute
suffered from a violent headache as the
result of her unexpected exertions, and the
little freshman cried herself to sleep, for she
had dreamed for nights of going with Suzanne,
whom she admired to stupefaction.</p>

<p>But of all this Evangeline Potts knew little,
and, it may be, cared less. She was one of
the successes of the evening, and her few remarks
were quoted diligently. She could have
danced dozens of extras, had so many been
possible, and Biscuits was considered to have
displayed more than her ordinary cleverness in
procuring a creature so picturesque and distinguished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>This did not surprise her, nor did she particularly
resent being pointed out by more than
one freshman as "the sophomore that took that
stunning Miss Potts"; but her amazement
was undisguised, the next morning but one,
at the sight of Evangeline walking out from
chapel with a prominent junior, the glamor of
the evening gone, it is true, her face somewhat
heavy and undeniably freckled, but nevertheless
an Evangeline transformed. From
her fluffy white cap to the hem of her dignified
black skirt she was the realization of Suzanne's
parting suggestions, and the distinct
intention of her costume had its full effect.
She was far more impressive than the jolly
little short-skirted junior, whose curly yellow
hair paled beside the dark richness of Evangeline's
massive coils, and Biscuits, remembering
that she had called her "a perfect stick,"
marvelled inwardly.</p>

<p>She went to call on her a little later, but
Evangeline was not in; and feeling that her
duty was done, Miss Kitts gave no further
thought to what she considered an essentially
uninteresting person, but devoted herself to
a study of the campus house into which she
had moved only that year.</p>

<p>She saw Evangeline very rarely after that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
except at the dances and plays, where her
white shoulders framed in auburn velvet appeared
very regularly. Once, happening to sit
beside her, she began a conversation, but she
could not remember afterward that Miss Potts
said anything but, "Yes, indeed," or, "Yes, I
think so, too." Her surprise was therefore
great when, on hearing the result of the sophomore
elections the next fall, and audibly commenting
on the oddity of Miss Evangeline
Potts in the position of sophomore president,
she was indignantly assured by a loyal member
of that class that the vote was almost
unanimous and that she was one of the ablest
girls in the class.</p>

<p>Even this she did not consider long, for the
sophomore presidency is the least important
of the four; but when among the first five
sophomores to be triumphantly ushered into
Phi Kappa Psi she was asked to consider the
name of Evangeline Potts, she remonstrated.</p>

<p>"But she's not clever! She's not half so
bright as lots we haven't got!" she objected.
"Why do we want her?"</p>

<p>"She's no prod, of course, but she's a
prominent girl and class president," was the
answer, "and she's really very strong, I think&mdash;they
say she does fair work, and everybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
but you wants her. Do you really disapprove
of her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Biscuits, and watched Miss
Potts with interest. She received her congratulations
quietly, with a manner that made one
wonder if they had been quite in good taste,
and acted altogether as if she had fully expected
to enter the society with Ursula Wyckoff
and Dodo Bent. The senior class president
took her out of chapel at the head of the file,
with a bunch of violets as big as her two fists
pinned to her belt, and Biscuits was asked to a
supper in her honor in the campus house she
had recently entered.</p>

<p>One of the other guests was the little freshman
Biscuits had first asked to the sophomore
reception, herself a sophomore now, and one
of Phi Kappa's first five.</p>

<p>"Was your class surprised at the elections?"
asked Biscuits, glancing half unconsciously at
Evangeline. The sophomore smiled gently,
with a hardly perceptible recognition of Biscuits'
look.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she replied; "we expected them&mdash;except,
perhaps, one or two." Her polite
little blush showed her traditional surprise at
her own success, and the junior gave the
equally traditional deprecating smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's the other?" she inquired bluntly.
The sophomore was taken off her guard and
glanced again at Evangeline.</p>

<p>"Why, some of us didn't exactly see&mdash;we
think Alison Greer's terribly bright&mdash;we
didn't expect&mdash;and yet, I don't know! After
all, I think perhaps we weren't so awfully
surprised!"</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder if you really weren't, or if
you're lying?" thought Biscuits, and then,
remembering suddenly, "but that's just the
way <i>we</i> all talked last year about Evelyn
Lyon!"</p>

<p>That summer Evangeline spent in France
with Suzanne, who informed Biscuits before
they sailed that though she couldn't find out
anything about Miss Potts' parents, she had
learned of the existence of a well-to-do uncle
in New Hampshire who intended leaving quite
a little money to his uncommunicative niece&mdash;he
had given her the money to go abroad.</p>

<p>"She planned it all out, and asked to go
with me, and I couldn't well refuse," said
Suzanne, "though Brother will be wild with
rage&mdash;he hates women who are not clever:
<i>il est un peu exigéant, mon frère</i>."</p>

<p>By senior year Biscuits had very nearly lost
track of Suzanne, who left the campus and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
spent most of her time sketching. Brother
had shown some pen-and-ink portraits of hers
to a great critic, who had declared that Brother
had by no means exhausted the family genius,
and Suzanne, heavily bribed, had returned to
her last year of durance. The day of the Junior
Prom Biscuits received a very French little
note inviting her to "<i>une première vue</i>,"
and with the full expectation of a pen-and-ink
collection, she confronted Evangeline, glorious
in white satin and gold passementerie, with
an amber chain and a great amber comb in her
hair.</p>

<p>"<i>Vous rappelez-vous cette première fois,
hein?</i>" Suzanne asked, with a grin. "<i>Ça date
de loin, n'est-ce pas?</i>" Adding cheerfully,
"<i>L'oncle est mort et nous avons une jolie dot!</i>"</p>

<p>Biscuits was not surprised to learn that
Ursula Wyckoff had moved heaven and earth
to get her cousin from Columbia for Evangeline's
escort; she had heard how Nan Gillatt
actually took her own brother to the Glee
Club concert because Evangeline preferred the
youth selected by Nan for herself, and she
remembered how <i>she</i> had hunted from shop to
shop for the velvet that matched that auburn
hair. It was not that Evangeline insisted: she
did not beg favors. But her habit of receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
a proposition in silence filled one with an irresistible
desire to better one's offer, and even
the improvement seemed poor in the calm
scrutiny of those red-brown eyes.</p>

<p>"What I can't see is, who pushes her!"
mused Biscuits.</p>

<p>"Who? who?" repeated Suzanne. "<i>Par
exemple!</i> Why, she herself, of course! Who
else?"</p>

<p>"But how?" Biscuits persisted. "Now Evelyn
made up to everybody so&mdash;she earned
her way, heaven knows! And Kate Ackley
was a sort of legacy&mdash;her sister's reputation
started her and she was rushed so freshman
year that you couldn't blame her for failing
to realize what a fool she really is. And the
Underhills' coming in with the crowd they
did, explains them. But nobody rushes Evangeline
particularly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>C'est bien dommage!</i>" Suzanne interrupted
with mock sympathy. "<i>Seule au monde!</i> Don't
be an idiot, Biscuits, we <i>all</i> rush her, and
we shall&mdash;till she begins to see what a bluff
she's making! The beauty of Evangeline is,
that she fools herself&mdash;<i>mais parfaitement</i>! She
really thinks she's somebody&mdash;<i>voilà tout!</i>"</p>

<p>"I suppose that's it," assented Biscuits,
thoughtfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>"Ursula," Suzanne remarked oracularly,
"is so anxious to please that sometimes she
doesn't, and even Susan the Great has her little
plans&mdash;<i>mais oui!</i> But Mlle. Potts doesn't
care a <i>sou</i>. It's all one to her, <i>vous savez</i>, she
agrees with all; and what's the result? <i>Tout le
monde l'admire! C'est toujours comme ça!</i>"</p>

<p>For some reason or other her large and
shapely figure was the most prominent feature
of Biscuits' Commencement. She was a junior
usher, of course, and in aisles or under lanterns,
at Phi Kappa Farewell or Glee Club
promenade, her calm, heavy face and deliberate
movements attracted Biscuits' eye.</p>

<p>The mob had not appealed to Miss Kitts
as a desirable method of dramatic début, and
she was, consequently, one of the few seniors
in the audience on the night of her class dramatics.
Between the acts she wandered down
to the door, and caught a bit of conversation
among a group of ushers.</p>

<p>"And all Ursula's friends were in the middle
aisle, and she begged Evangeline to
change, but she wouldn't. Ursula could have
had a seat then, with Dick Fosdick's people,
and she was frightfully tired, but Evangeline
wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Pooh! did you expect she would?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! She's terribly selfish, of course,
but you'd think, considering how nice Ursula's
been to her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! As if <i>that</i> made any difference
to Evange&mdash;sh, here she is!&mdash;What
stunning violets, Evangeline! That's your
Prom dress, isn't it? It's terribly sweet!"</p>

<p>Evangeline smiled and sank into the seat
a little freshman promptly and adoringly vacated
for her, and Biscuits went back to her
place.</p>

<p>Suzanne stopped in America that summer,
and with the promise of five subsequent years
in Paris, prolonged her stay till the following
June. She went so far as to come up to Northampton
to her class reunion, assuring her
friends that she had forgotten a few opprobrious
epithets in her final anathema and had
returned to deliver them in person.</p>

<p>As they stood in the crowd on Ivy Day,
watching the snowy procession, the cameras
suddenly snapped rapidly all about them and
an excited voice murmured: "There she is!
Isn't she grand? My dear, she had eleven invitations
for the junior entertainment! Martha
Sutton took her&mdash;" Evangeline Potts
walked slowly by.</p>

<p>"And you ought to have seen her Commencement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
flowers! She had a bathtub full&mdash;literally!
She wouldn't take 'em out and
the tub couldn't be used&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's president of Phi Kapp, I hear,"
said Biscuits.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Suzanne, "and on the
dramatics committee, you know. She has lots
of friends."</p>

<p>"I wonder why," said Biscuits, absently.</p>

<p>"<i>'Sais pas!</i> They're clever girls, too. She
knows the pick of the class&mdash;but then, she
always did, you know."</p>

<p>"I suppose she'll marry money," mused
Biscuits, the student of human nature.</p>

<p>"<i>Du tout!</i>" Suzanne returned, "she won't
care about that. It's clever people she wants&mdash;she
always went with the clever ones: <i>elle
aime les gens d'esprit</i>. She's got money enough;
she'll marry some clever man who knows the
best people and will make her one of them&mdash;<i>vous
l'verrez!</i>"</p>

<p>And the prophecy was fulfilled, for Evangeline
very shortly married Walter Endicott,
the well-known artist, whose portrait of her
in white and gold attracted so much attention
at a very recent <i>Salon</i>.

<p class="stories">I<br />

DRAMATICS</p>

<p><i>It is the Saturday night performance of
the senior play. The curtain is about to
rise. The aisles and back of the house are
packed with people struggling for seats;
alumnæ and under-class girls who have admission
tickets only, are preparing to sit on all the
steps; the junior ushers are hopelessly trying to
keep back the press. It is to be supposed that the
orchestra is playing, judging from the motion of
arms and instruments. The lights are suddenly
lowered and the curtain rises. The struggle for
seats at the back, the expostulations of the ushers,
and the comments of the alumnæ and students,
who have seen the play twice before and consequently
do not feel the need of close attention, completely
drown the first words of the scene.</i></p>

<p><i>Back of house. Large and fussy mother, looking
daggers at the sophomores squatting beside
her, giggling at the useless efforts of a small
worried usher to prevent a determined woman,
escorted by her apologetic husband, from prancing
down into the orchestra circle; and unimportant
senior.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> What? What? Who is this, Emma?
Where are we?</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> That's Viola, Mother. She's just
been shipwrecked, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Oh, she's the heroine. She's the
best actor, then?</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Dear me, no. Malvolio's 'way by
the best. And then Sir Toby and Maria&mdash;they're
awfully good&mdash;you'll see them pretty
soon now. I don't care for Viola much. She
tries to imitate Ada Rehan&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Curtain drops on First Scene.</i></p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Orchestra Circle. Handsome, portly father,
exceptionally well set up, his wife, and head of
department.</i></p>

<p><i>Father, with enthusiasm.</i> By Jove! Is that
a girl, really? You don't say so! Well, well!
Sir Toby, eh? Well, well! And who's the
little girl? Maria? Did you ever see anything
much prettier than she is, Alice?</p>

<p><i>His Wife.</i> She's very charming, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Head of Department.</i> She's about the best
of them. A very clever girl. But you ought to
see Malvolio! I don't care for Sir Andrew&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> Alice, look at him! Did you ever
see anything so odd? Now I call that clever&mdash;I
must say I call that clever! To think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
that's a girl&mdash;well, well! See him shiver, Alice!
Capital, capital! Do they do this themselves&mdash;costumes
and acting and ideas and
all?</p>

<p><i>Head of Department.</i> They make the costumes,
I believe, most of them. Then they
have a trainer at the last. It's amazing to me,
but as a matter of fact their men's parts are as
a rule, considering the proportionate difficulty,
you know, much better than their women's.
Comedy parts, at that. I've never seen but
one woman's part really well done.</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> Really? Now why do you suppose,
sir, that is so?</p>

<p><i>Head of Department.</i> I can't say. But they're
very artificial women, as a rule. Overtrained,
perhaps.</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>A group of last year's graduates and two ushers
on the platform of the fire-escape upstairs.</i></p>

<p><i>First Graduate.</i> I suppose you're nearly
dead, poor child?</p>

<p><i>First Usher.</i> Heavens! I never slaved so in
my life! Did you see Ethel Williams' mother
<i>insist</i> on going down into her seat? I don't see
how people can be so rude.</p>

<p><i>First Graduate.</i> Going better, to-night, isn't
it?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p><i>First Usher.</i> Goodness, yes! I think it's fine.
Don't you? Isn't Dick <i>simply fine</i>! There she
is! (<i>A burst of applause as Malvolio and Olivia
enter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Second Usher.</i> Do you know, they say that
Kate Ackley thinks it's half for her!</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> Not really?</p>

<p><i>Second Usher.</i> Yes, really. She is stunning,
there's no doubt.</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> Oh, yes, she's stunning.
Is that her own dress?</p>

<p><i>Second Usher.</i> Yes. Her aunt gave it to her.
It's liberty satin. But she's a stick, just the
same. Do you like Viola?</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate, parrying.</i> She looks very
well. I was rather surprised she got it, though.</p>

<p><i>Second Usher.</i> You know Mr. Clark wanted
her for Sir Andrew, and she wouldn't. He was
very angry, and so was the class. They don't
care for Ethel at all. But it was Viola or nothing.
She's seen it four times and she thinks
she knows it all, they say. I <i>do</i> think she does
some parts very well indeed.</p>

<p><i>First Usher.</i> Oh, Miss Underhill, isn't
Viola grand? Don't you think she's fine?</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate, sweetly.</i> Yes, indeed. She
looks so cunning in that short skirt!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Curtain falls on First Act.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Two fathers standing at back.</i></p>

<p><i>First Father, smiling affably.</i> A great sight,
I assure you, sir! All these young girls, and
parents, and friends&mdash;a proud moment for
them! And how well they do! That one
that takes the part of Malvolio, now, that
Miss Fosdick&mdash;pretty smart girl, now, isn't
she?</p>

<p><i>Second Father.</i> That's my daughter, sir.</p>

<p><i>First Father.</i> Well, well! I expect you're
pretty pleased. You ought to be.</p>

<p><i>Second Father, confidentially.</i> I tell you, sir, I
never believed she had it in her, never! Her
mother and I were perfectly dumfounded&mdash;perfectly.
I don't know where she got it from;
certainly not from me. And her mother
couldn't take part in tableaux, even, she got
so nervous.</p>

<p><i>First Father.</i> Just so, just so! Now, I want
to tell you something, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Fosdick.
These colleges for women are a great thing,
sir, a great thing! You take my daughter.
When she came up here, she was as shy and
bashful and helpless as a girl that's an only
child could possibly be. Couldn't trust herself
an inch alone. Never went away from
home alone in her life. Look at her now!
She's head of this whole committee: you may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
have noticed their names on the back of the
programme. Costumes, scenery, music, lights,
stage properties, scene shifting&mdash;all in her
hands, as you might say! I slipped up to the
stage door, and I begged the young woman
there to let me step in and see her a moment.
Girls do it all, you know! She was on policeman
duty there. But she let me in and I just
peeked at Mary, bossing the whole job, as you
might say! It was "put this here" and "put
that there" and taking hold of the end and
dragging it herself, and answering this one's
questions and giving that one orders&mdash;I tell
you, I couldn't believe it! Short skirt and
shirt-waist, note-book in her hand&mdash;Lord! I
wished I had her up at the office with me!</p>

<p><i>Second Father.</i> Then you're Miss Mollie
Vanderveer's father?</p>

<p><i>First Father.</i> Yes, sir, James L. Vanderveer.</p>

<p><i>Second Father.</i> Pleased to meet you. 'Lida
often speaks of her. She said to her mother
and me to-night just as she went down to "be
made up," as they call it, that Mollie was a
brick and no mistake. It seems she's doing
two girls' work to-night.</p>

<p><i>First Father.</i> Yes, one of the committee is
sick. After all, it's a pretty hard strain, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
seems to me. Mary's pretty strong, but she
said to me yesterday that if there had been
another performance&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Curtain rises on Second Act.</i></p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Lobby. College physician and junior usher.</i></p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> Will you just step over to the
drug store across the street and get me some
brandy&mdash;quickly, please?</p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> Oh, certainly, Dr. Leach!</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> Here, child, stop! Put on a cloak&mdash;are
you crazy?</p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> But I'm quite warm, Dr. Leach!</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> Put on a cloak! With your neck
and arms bare! It's damp as a well outside.
(<i>Usher runs out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>A ubiquitous member of the faculty suddenly
appears.</i> What's the matter? Anybody sick?</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> Oh, no! Not much. Miss Jackson
was resting in her dressing-room and
somebody leaned over the sill and spoke to
her&mdash;you know she's on the ground floor.
She's quite nervous, and she got a little hysterical&mdash;slight
chill. My brandy was all out,
so I&mdash;Oh, thank you! (<i>Usher disappears
breathless.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ubiquitous Member of Faculty, gloomily.</i> I've
always said there should be understudies&mdash;always.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
What will they do without their Viola?
It's a ridiculous risk&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Physician, hastily.</i> But Miss Jackson is all
right, or will be as soon as I get&mdash;yes, I'm
coming! Oh, nonsense!&mdash;She's all right:
there's no need for an understudy, I assure
you!&mdash;No, keep them all out! No, she has
enough flowers in there now! Yes, keep people
away from the window!</p>

<p class="p2 center">¶ <i>Curtain rises on Third Scene.</i></p>

<p><i>Group of ushers collapsed on stairs leading to
gallery.</i></p>

<p><i>Nan.</i> (<i>White organdie over rose pink silk;
rose ribbons.</i>) Oh, girls, I'm nearly dead!</p>

<p><i>Ursula.</i> (<i>Black net over electric blue satin;
silver belt and high silver comb; black gloves.</i>)
There's one good thing, we're downstairs
to-night. Last night I got so dizzy hopping
up and down those steps&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Leonora.</i> (<i>Yellow liberty silk cut very low;
gold fillet; somewhat striking Greek effect.</i>) Oh,
what do you think I just did? I was so tired I
stumbled just behind the orchestra circle (after
I'd shooed that funny woman out of three
seats) and I fell almost flat! And the nicest
man helped me up and made me take his seat,
and who do you think it was? It was Mr. Fosdick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
He went and stood back, and I sat a
long time then. Wasn't he ducky?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> (<i>White dimity with green ribbons; a
yard or more of red-gold hair; babyish face.</i>)
Where's your own seat, dear?</p>

<p><i>Esther.</i> (<i>Pale blue silk with long rope of mock
pearls.</i>) Oh, Piggy's given it to her little
friend, as usual! It's a great thing to have&mdash;(<i>The
door swings open, and the actors' voices are
heard</i>: "There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady,
lady!" <i>Another usher comes out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Nan.</i> How'd the song go? Better?</p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> Oh, grand! They made her do the
second verse again. Miss Selbourne says that
she's the best all 'round clown they've ever
had.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Oh, does she? I heard her tell Dr. Lyman
that the plays deteriorated every year&mdash;(<i>Enter
another usher.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Second Usher.</i> Girls, you <i>must</i> be quiet! That
woman at the back says she can't hear a
word&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Curtain rises on Fourth Scene; applause, as
audience takes in stage setting. Row of enthusiastic
alumnæ in upper box.</i></p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> (<i>Happy mother of three; head
of sewing circle; leader of the most advanced set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
in her college days; president of the Anti-Engagement
League, junior year.</i>) Oh, girls, did
you ever see anything so lovely? How <i>do</i> they
manage it? We never imagined anything like
it, I'm perfectly willing to admit. Aren't those
lords and ladies fine? Why, look at them&mdash;there
must be forty or fifty! And aren't the
costumes beautiful? How handsome Orsino
is!</p>

<p><i>Second Alumna.</i> (<i>Rising journalist; very well
dressed; knows all the people of note in the audience;
affects a society manner; was known as the
Gloomy Genius in her college days, and never
talked with any one who didn't read Browning.</i>)
Quite professional, really! How that Miss
Jackson reminds one of Rehan! I wonder if
Daly sends the trainer? That little Maria,
now&mdash;she's quite unusual. Lovely figure,
hasn't she? Elizabeth Quentin Twitchell.
Dr. Twitchell of Cambridge, I wonder? Do
they set that stage alone?</p>

<p><i>Third Alumna.</i> (<i>Blonde and gushing; sister
in the cast.</i>) You know, that Miss Twitchell
was the best Viola, too, they say. Peggy tells
me Mr. Clark says he wished she could play
them both. She's very popular with the class.
But Miss Jackson does everything. Writes,
acts, plays basket-ball, beautiful class work&mdash;Oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
isn't that sweet! (<i>Clown and chorus of
ladies with mandolins and guitars sing to wild
applause.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fourth Alumna.</i> (<i>Tall, thin, dark, and dowdy;
very humble in manner; high-principled; worth
two millions in her own right; slaved throughout
her entire college course.</i>) I don't see how anybody
can say that girls can't do anything in the
world they set out to. Isn't it wonderful? You
can say what you please, but it's just as Ella
says&mdash;they do ten times what we did and do
it better too. I think they're prettier than they
used to be, don't you? And they're just like
real actors&mdash;I'm sure it's prettier than any
play I ever saw! They make such wonderful
men! Would you ever know that Sir Toby was
a girl? And Malvolio&mdash;he's just too good for
anything!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Curtain falls on Fourth Scene.</i></p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>There is a long wait in total darkness. The
audience smiles, then settles down to be amused.
Somebody faints and is restored with shuffling,
apologies, and salts.</i></p>

<p><i>Slender, dark-eyed, gray-haired man, with
non-committal expression, uncle of one of the
Mob; with his wife, who grows more frankly
puzzled as the play advances.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> I suppose they've outdone themselves
in this garden scene.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Yes, Bertha says they've worked
tremendously over it. Henry, what <i>do</i> you
think of it?</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> Very ingenious, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> But Henry, their voices&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> They <i>are</i> a little destructive to the illusion,
but you hear the gentleman behind me.
He assures us that he thinks they are men!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Oh, <i>Henry</i>!</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> It's a pity they haven't more like
Maria. Viola could take a few points from her.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> But Bertha says that they adore
Viola. She writes, and plays basket-ball, and
stands high in her classes, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> But she isn't an actress, that's all.
She shouldn't grasp all the arts! She's too
melodramatic&mdash;she rants.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Bertha says the trainer admires her
very much&mdash;he wants her to go on the stage.</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> Oh! does he?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Did you know that even the mobs are
trained very carefully? Bertha says she goes to
rehearsals all the time. And the principal parts&mdash;Malvolio
worked six hours with Mr. Clark
one day and eight the next. And Viola had
to do more. And the stage committee <i>slave</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Henry, they simply slave. Little Esther
Brookes is worn to a shadow&mdash;not but what
they love to do it.</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> And when did Malvolio and Viola
and the stage committee do their studying?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Oh, they keep up with their work.
It's a point of honor with them, Bertha says.
Of course they can't do <i>quite</i> so much, I suppose&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> I suppose not.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> But Bertha says that they would give
up anything in college sooner than that. Viola
and Malvolio, both of them, say that they regard
it as the most valuable training they've
gotten up here. They say it's quite the equal
of any of their courses.</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> Ah! do they?</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Curtain rises on a very elaborate garden scene
of arbors and flowers; frantic applause, doubled
at the entrance of Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.</i></p>

<p><i>Group of cynical alumnæ on fire-escape.</i></p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> As for that Sir Toby&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second Alumna.</i> Hush, my dear, that may
be the bosom of her family forninst us!</p>

<p><i>First Alumna, lowering her voice.</i> I think
he's indecent and ridiculous.</p>

<p><i>Second Alumna.</i> He'll be the pride of the class,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
my little cousin says. They're raving over him.</p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> Then they're idiots. My
dear, we may have had our faults, but we were
seldom vulgar, if we weren't remarkable!</p>

<p><i>Third Alumna.</i> What I mind so much is that
all the papers are filled with that trash about
gracefulness and womanliness and girlish delicacy
and the great gulf between us and the
coarse professionals, and as far as I can see,
we are filling in that gulf as fast as possible.
We seem to be striving after the very thing&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> Precisely. In a word, it's
Daly, not Shakespeare. And they don't see
that Dalyism takes money&mdash;we haven't the
scenery and costumes for it.</p>

<p><i>Second Alumna.</i> That horrible Sir Andrew!</p>

<p><i>Fourth Alumna.</i> But Malvolio&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> Oh, Malvolio's all right.
As far as a girl can do it. The question is, <i>can</i>
a girl do it? I think she can't.</p>

<p><i>Third Alumna.</i> And as for allowing that Miss
Jackson to imitate all Ada Rehan's bad points,
when she naturally fails of her good ones&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fourth Alumna.</i> But, my dear, the men like
it. They're all pleased to death. They think
it's the cleverest thing they ever saw. They
say Viola's magnetic&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Third Alumna.</i> Hgh! She's coarse, if that's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
what you mean! The whole tone of the thing
is lowered. I think that way she acted the
duel scene last night was simply vulgar. But
the girls all howled with laughter.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Alumna.</i> Well, if they're pleased&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> They shouldn't be pleased!</p>

<p><i>Fourth Alumna.</i> Surely, Annie, you think
this garden scene is funny!</p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> Why, I laughed. It's a good
acting play. But I wish the Literature department
had more to do with it and the trainer
confined himself to&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Usher interrupts.</i> If you please, I must ask
you to make less noise. You are disturbing
the people near the door!</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>The curtain has fallen on the Fourth Act. A
group of last year's graduates standing at the
back in party-cloaks, with a few of the Mob in
shirt-waists and make-up.</i></p>

<p><i>Recent Court Lady, tentatively.</i> Did you like
the dance?</p>

<p><i>First Graduate.</i> Oh, it was fine! It was terribly
pretty, Ellen, the whole thing!</p>

<p><i>Recent Court Lady, relieved.</i> I'm so glad you
liked it. Wasn't Sue grand!</p>

<p><i>First Graduate.</i> Yes, indeed, but I liked
Malvolio so much!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p><i>Court Gentleman.</i> Good old Dick! My, don't
we love her! Orsino's going to do him at class
supper, you know. And Olivia's going to be
Sir Toby.</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> How noble! Sir Toby is
about the best I ever saw, May.</p>

<p><i>Court Gentleman.</i> Isn't she that? She's going
to be Viola. She squirms and twists just
like her&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Court Lady.</i> Oh, come on, May Lucy, and
get to bed! (<i>They go out whistling airs from
the play and are violently suppressed by a group
of ushers, whose excited remonstrances are loudly
criticised by a large and nervous lady in the rear,
greatly delighting the contingent from the Mob.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Graduate.</i> Now, Katharine, just tell
me, perfectly impartially of course, how you
think it compares with ours.</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> Well, girls, frankly I must
say I'm a little disappointed. (<i>Nods from the
others.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Third Graduate.</i> It's not that it's not well
done, for it is, but it's such a fine play it
ought to have been well done by anybody.
And for all that Sue Jackson's such a wonder,
I must say&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fourth Graduate.</i> Yes, exactly. She's too
heavy for the part, I think.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> Of course Toby was fine
and Malvolio and Maria&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fifth Graduate.</i> Well, then, with three fine
ones I should think&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> But Olivia and Sebastian
and Orsino were such sticks&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fourth Graduate.</i> Still, those third and
fourth and fifth scenes in the second act were
beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> But the others were so
plain. They just stacked on the good ones.
Still, I suppose they did the best they could.
Mary Vanderveer has just <i>slaved</i> over it.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Graduate.</i> We know what <i>that</i> is!</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> Well, honestly, I think
this is a <i>prettier</i> play than ours, but I do feel
that ours was a little <i>better done</i>! Here, let's
see Sue in this. I think she's pretty good.</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>The curtain has fallen on the Fifth Act. Malvolio
and Viola come out of their dressing-room
to the street, and slip out of a crowd of ushers
and under-class girls. A general flutter of congratulation
and sympathy follows them.</i></p>

<p>Oh, Miss Jackson, it was great! Simply
fine! Susy, my child, say what you'd like and
it's yours!&mdash;Where's Lida Fosdick?&mdash;Lida!
Dick! She's gone long ago. Where's Toby?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Gone, too. Somebody has some flowers for
her. Oh, take 'em up to the Wallace!&mdash;Well,
good-night! Wasn't it grand!&mdash;Grand!
There's Betty! Hi, Betty! Oh, Miss Twitchell,
it was so&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Twitchell, mechanically.</i> So glad, so
glad you liked it&mdash;we loved to do it! Oh, yes!
Oh, dear, no! Just a little, yes. The making-up
was so long. Mother&mdash;thank you, <i>thank</i>
you&mdash;Mother, where <i>is</i> the carriage? Oh,
thank you <i>so</i> much!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Twitchell, nervously.</i> Yes, indeed, she's
tired to death. I'm very glad, I'm sure, if you
liked it. Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Waite?
Yes, here she is. Bessie, here is Mrs. Waite.
You see she sat in the Opera House since
five o'clock to be made up, and only sandwiches
and all the strain&mdash;yes, indeed. Fanny
looked very pretty, I thought. In the dance,
wasn't she? Yes, so pretty. I'm sure I wish
Bessie had only been in the dance&mdash;Oh, here's
the carriage, dear!</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Malvolio and Viola, slipping quietly past the
crowd; make-up not off; arms on each other's
shoulders.</i></p>

<p><i>Malvolio.</i> I suppose Dad's holding that
carriage somewhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> Well, I can't help it. I simply can't
talk to everybody.</p>

<p><i>Malvolio.</i> Do you know your speech?</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> I think so. It's so short, you know.
I hate to have the president's speech long.
(<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Malvolio.</i> Well, it's over, Susy Revere!
No more glory for little Lide and Sue!</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> All over! Well, we've had the time
of our lives, Dick! I'd&mdash;I'd give anything
to do it over again, three nights!</p>

<p><i>Malvolio.</i> Me too. It's a pleasant little spot
up here. (<i>They walk to the campus in silence.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Recent court lady and two young gentlemen,
brothers of her friend, the stage manager. Her
eyes are underlined heavily, and she has not gotten
the rouge quite off her cheeks.</i></p>

<p><i>Recent Court Lady.</i> Oh, <i>thank</i> you, it would
be <i>such</i> a help! Mollie is nearly wild, and these
things must be got out to-night. If you would
take this and this and this, and oh, Father,
would you please carry this tankard and the
cups? And could you take those two swords?
I'll take the distaff and the mandolin. Jack,
have you room for the moon? Will, here
are more poppies, and I promised Ada that
I'd put that rubber-plant in her room to-night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
You're so good! You're sure you
don't mind carrying them? Now don't get
laughing, Father, and drop the cups.</p>

<p><i>A Recent Court Gentleman.</i> Good-night, dear!
I knew you'd like it. Oh, I think everybody
seems to feel it's the best yet. Of course, last
year they had so much better opportunity, so
much easier scenery. But with four such stars&mdash;yes,
indeed. It was so much harder to find
people to take&mdash;oh, she <i>did</i>! She thinks that
just because it doesn't all depend on one or
two people, it's easier? Well, just find your
extra people, that's all!&mdash;Did you like it? Most
people seemed to think it <i>was</i> a pretty dance.
Well, we rehearsed enough, heaven knows.
Did you know Orsino's fiancé was there? She
said she felt like such an idiot. Too bad Sue
got scared, wasn't it? Well, good-night.</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Steps of the Dewey House. Three ushers
propped against the pillars. The night watchman
approaches with lantern.</i></p>

<p><i>Watchman.</i> Well, well, well! Want to get
in? <i>Hi'll</i> bet yer do! (<i>First usher nods her
head.</i>) Are yer h'ushers? Fine play, wa'n't
it? (<i>Second usher nods her head.</i>) Well, you
do look tired! You pretty tired, Miss Slater?
(<i>Third usher murmurs something about sleeping

till noon, and second usher chuckles feebly and
mentions Baccalaureate. They stumble into the
Dewey, and the watchman shuts the door.</i>)</p>

<p class="stories">II<br />
IVY DAY</p>

<p><i>The sun is glaring down on the campus. A
crowd of parents and other relatives is surging
toward an awning near the steps of College
Hall; a stream of white-dressed seniors continually
flows toward the Hatfield House, where a procession
is forming. Forty junior ushers struggle with
a rope wound with laurel, which is to encompass
the column of seniors. A few scattered members
of the Faculty and a crowd of alumnæ wander
aimlessly about, obstructing traffic generally.</i></p>

<p><i>Small imperious mother, dragging large good-humored
father toward the awning.</i> Hurry up,
Father, hurry up!</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> But Mother, I want to see 'em!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Well, you've got to take your
choice of seeing 'em and not hearing a word
of the speech or&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> You go right along, Mother, and
I'll get there on time. I want to see Hattie
marching.</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>A crowd of girls with cameras rushes up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
lines both sides of the walk. Two ushers sail up
the path, clearing a way with white-ribboned
sticks. The crowd becomes unmanageable, torn by
the desire to watch the progress of the march and
at the same time to secure a good place at the exercises.
People summon each other wildly from
various points of the campus.</i></p>

<p><i>A group of strolling sophomores, dodging some
ushers and wheedling programmes from others,
screws its way in a body to the best possible position
in the front, smiling at the efforts of the displaced
to reinstate themselves.</i></p>

<p><i>First Sophomore.</i> There they come! There's
Sue and Betty Twitchell! My, what roses!</p>

<p><i>Second Sophomore.</i> Roses? Did the ushers&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Third Sophomore.</i> Oh, goodness, Win,
haven't you heard that yet?</p>

<p><i>Second Sophomore.</i> No&mdash;tell me!</p>

<p><i>Third Sophomore.</i> Why, Miss Tomlinson's
fiancé sent her fifteen dozen American Beauties,
and there wasn't any room for them in the
house, and she asked if the class would like to
carry them, and first they voted no and then
they voted yes, and some of the girls don't
like it, but they are doing it just the same&mdash;Oh,
isn't Helen Estabrook's gown stunning!
There's Wilhelmina&mdash;Hello, Will! Sue looks
well, don't you think?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second Sophomore.</i> Fifteen dozen American
Beauties! Great heavens!</p>

<p><i>First Sophomore.</i> I think it's perfectly absurd
and bad taste, too. The idea!</p>

<p><i>Third Sophomore.</i> Well, she's not to blame,
is she? They're certainly lots prettier than
laurel or daisies or odd flowers&mdash;Oh, girls, <i>I</i>
think Louise Hunter is too silly for anything!
She feels too big to live, leading the way! I'd
try to look a little less like a poker if I <i>was</i>
an usher!</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>The Ivy Procession marches to the steps two
and two, each girl with an enormous American
Beauty in her hand. At every step the girls with
cameras snap and turn, so that the sound resembles
a miniature volley of cannon. There is a comparative
silence during their progress.</i></p>

<p><i>Mother and daughter standing on their seats
under awning, clutching at the heads of those
near them for support.</i></p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Who is that with Susy, dear?</p>

<p><i>Daughter.</i> That's the vice-president&mdash;I
don't know her name. Sue looks pale, doesn't
she?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> And that's Bess Twitchell next&mdash;with
the tucks. She's Ivy Orator, you know.
I think Sue's dress drops too much in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
back&mdash;Ah, Miss Fosdick has stepped on it!
Good heavens&mdash;right on that Valenciennes!
(<i>She sits down abruptly.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>The procession winds slowly up and groups
itself on the steps. The last third stands a long
while before the awning and exchanges somewhat
conscious remarks with its friends outside the
rope, which the ushers endeavor to carry without
straining or dropping: this attempt puckers their
foreheads and tilts their hats.</i></p>

<p><i>A group of last year's graduates standing close
to the enclosure.</i></p>

<p><i>First Graduate.</i> Stunning gowns, aren't
they?</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> Awfully. Prettiest I ever
saw. And so different, too! And yet they're
all alike&mdash;organdie over silk or satin, mostly.
Isn't Sue Jackson's lovely?</p>

<p><i>Third Graduate.</i> I like Esther Brookes';
it's so plain, but there's not a more artistic&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fourth Graduate.</i> How do you like Lena
Bergstein's?</p>

<p><i>Fifth Graduate.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Fourth Graduate.</i> My dear, haven't you
seen that? It's solid Valenciennes as far as I
can see. I think it's altogether too elaborate.
But I tell you, it's stunning, all the same!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fifth Graduate.</i> Ah, I see it! Poor taste, I
think.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Graduate.</i> I know it. Betty Twitchell's
is so simple&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Graduate.</i> Simple, yes! It's imported,
I happen to know!</p>

<p><i>Fourth Graduate.</i> Really! It <i>does</i> hang beautifully!
Oh, they're moving: there's Sir
Toby. You know nobody ever heard of her
before, girls. Isn't that funny? Wasn't she
great, though?</p>

<p><i>Second Graduate.</i> Well, they won't forget
her in a hurry. I think it's a mighty good
thing that Dramatics brings out that kind
of girl and gives her a place in the class. It
keeps two or three girls like Sue Jackson
and Twitchie and Mollie Van from running
everything. Well, going to stay here?</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>A Ubiquitous member of the Faculty suddenly
dashes from her seat and pushes through the crowd,
which lets her out, under the impression that she
is faint.</i></p>

<p><i>Ubiquitous Member of Faculty, to a scared
usher.</i> Where is Dr. Twitchell? Is he back
there?</p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> I&mdash;I don't know! Is he big?</p>

<p><i>Ubiquitous Member of Faculty.</i> Big? Big?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
What do you mean? A pretty thing&mdash;to have
the father of the Ivy Orator have no seat! He
must be found!</p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> I&mdash;I'll go see&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ubiquitous Member of Faculty.</i> Do you know
him?</p>

<p><i>Usher, helpless but optimistic.</i> No, but I'll&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ubiquitous Member of Faculty, suddenly dashing
through the crowd into a lilac clump and producing,
to every one's amazement, a large and
amiable gentleman from its centre.</i> Well, well!
Are you going to remain here long, Dr.
Twitchell? Why aren't you in your seat?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Twitchell, somewhat embarrassed at his
prominent position, but beaming on every one.</i>
Why, no&mdash;that is, yes, indeed! Certainly.
I only wanted to see Bessie march along with
the rest. A very pretty sight&mdash;remarkably so!
All in white&mdash;I counted ninety couples, I
think. Has&mdash;has she begun? Is her mother&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ubiquitous Member of Faculty.</i> We're all in
the front row, and they've not begun. The class
president will be making her speech in a moment&mdash;there
is plenty of time, but we were a
little anxious&mdash;(<i>They enter the enclosure.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>The class is crowded upon the steps and overflows
before and behind them. The sun is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
their eyes, and they look strained and pale. Under
the awning a few hundred relatives fan themselves,
and smile expectantly.</i></p>

<p><i>The class president makes an indistinguishable
address, in which the phrases "more glad
than I can say," "unusual opportunity," "women's
education," "extends a hearty welcome,"
rise above the rest, and sinks back into the crowd.</i></p>

<p><i>The leader of the Glee Club frowns at her
mates and leans forward: the class sings "Fair
Smith," with a great deal of contralto. The Ivy
Orator steps back and upward instinctively, with
an idea of escaping from the heads and shoulders
that are packed like herring about her, realizes
that the audience is entirely out of her reach, steps
down to meet them, becomes lost to view, and with
a despairing consciousness that nothing can better
the most futile position she has ever occupied, steps
back to her first place and shrieks out her opening
phrases.</i></p>

<p><i>Two mothers sitting on a bench just behind the
enclosure, looking over the campus.</i></p>

<p><i>First Mother.</i> So you didn't get a seat?</p>

<p><i>Second Mother.</i> Well, I didn't try, to tell
the truth. I'm interested in the speech, but
my daughter tells me that I can see it in the
<i>Monthly</i> next fall, and as I got here so late, I
couldn't possibly hear it from the back.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p><i>First Mother.</i> I was sorry to leave, for Kate
wanted me to hear Bessie so much; but after
Miss Jackson's speech I had to go&mdash;the heat
made me rather faint. And as you say, one
can read it.</p>

<p><i>Second Mother.</i> That's what every one seems
to think&mdash;see them all walking up and down
here. One of the old graduates&mdash;a friend of
my daughter's&mdash;told me that this was the
chance for them to talk with the professors!</p>

<p><i>First Mother.</i> Well, I suppose if they <i>will</i>
have it outdoors, very many people can't expect
to hear. It's very hard to speak in the
open air.</p>

<p><i>Second Mother.</i> Yes, indeed. What a fine-looking
girl that Miss Ackley is&mdash;the dark
one&mdash;did you notice her?</p>

<p><i>First Mother.</i> That is my daughter, so I've
noticed her quite a little!</p>

<p><i>Second Mother.</i> Oh, indeed! I'm sure I
didn't know&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Mother.</i> It isn't necessary to be told
that <i>you</i> have a daughter here, Mrs. Fosdick!</p>

<p><i>Second Mother.</i> No, everybody seems to
think that the resemblance is very strong indeed.
Isn't it pleasant to meet people so
strangely, and without any ceremony, like this?
It's a very pleasant place, anyway, isn't it?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p><i>First Mother.</i> Yes, indeed. It's beautiful
all the spring, but particularly beautiful now,
I think, with all the girls in their pretty
dresses and the general holiday effect.</p>

<p><i>Second Mother.</i> What I like so much is the
spirit of the place. When we found out from
things in my daughter's letters and stories
she would tell us in the vacations that all her
little set of friends were very much richer than
she and could afford luxuries and enjoyments
that she couldn't, Mr. Fosdick and I were
quite worried for fear that she would feel hurt,
you know, or want to get into a style of living
that she could not possibly keep up. But, dear
me, we needn't have worried! It never made
the least difference, just as she assured us.
We were very glad to find that she was the
friend of some of the leading girls in the class,
when we saw that she went right along as she
had to, tutoring and selling blue prints and
going about just as contentedly as if her shirt-waists
had been their organdies. Not that that
sort of thing <i>ought</i> to make any difference, but
sometimes it <i>does</i>, you know. She was telling
me about Bess Twitchell's Commencement
dress, and Sue Jackson's, and I grew quite
alarmed, for I thought that perhaps that was
expected, and we couldn't possibly afford anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
like it. But, dear me, it was all the same
to her! She was perfectly satisfied with muslin,
and when I asked her if she was sure she'd
prefer to walk with Bess, she actually made
me feel ashamed! Bess herself said that it
wasn't every one who could have the honor
of walking with Malvolio, and she'd like to
see herself lose it!</p>

<p><i>First Mother.</i> Oh, of course! Why, I have
always understood, both from Kate and her
cousin who graduated three years ago, that
some of the leading girls in every class were
poor. The girls seemed prouder of them, if
anything. As you say, it's the spirit of the
place. Now Kate herself&mdash;well, it's a little
thing, I suppose, but her father and I&mdash;well,
I suppose any one would think us silly, but
we actually cried, we were so touched. Her
father gave her her dress&mdash;it was really lovely.
Not elaborate, but it was made over beautiful
silk, and he gave her a handsome string of
those mock pearls they wear so much now,
you know. It was very becoming to her indeed,
and she was delighted with it.</p>

<p>Well, just three weeks ago I got a long letter
from her saying that Eleanor Hunt's father
had lost every cent he had in the world and
that they were in a dreadful condition. Eleanor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
mother had sold her Commencement
gown and Eleanor was going to wear an old
white organdie that she'd worn all the year to
dances and plays. She said that Eleanor was
feeling very bad indeed about it and especially
about Commencement time. They had planned
to walk together in all the processions&mdash;they
are great friends. So she asked me if I thought
Papa would mind if she wore her old organdie,
too, to all the things, because Eleanor
seemed to feel it so. Her father offered to give
Eleanor one for a Commencement present from
her, but she wouldn't have that&mdash;she said
Eleanor wouldn't like it&mdash;she was feeling
very proud about gifts, just now.</p>

<p>Well, her father was more pleased than I've
seen him for years. You see, Kate has always
thought a great deal of her clothes, and she's
always had a good allowance, besides lots of
presents from us and her aunts. And being an
only child, you know&mdash;well, I wouldn't say
she was <i>spoiled</i> at all, but she certainly was a
little thoughtless, perhaps selfish, when she
came up here. Her father and I feel that it has
done a great deal for her. He says that he'd
call it a good investment if she'd never learned
anything in all the four years but just how to
do that one thing!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second Mother.</i> Yes, indeed! We feel, Mr.
Fosdick and I, that my daughter's friends
have been almost as good for her as what she
learned, though that comes first, as she must
teach, now. She was always so solitary and reserved
and never cared for the girls at home,
but here she has such good friends and loves
them all so&mdash;she's grown more natural, more
like other girls; and we lay it all to her having
been thrown in from the beginning with
such pleasant, nice girls as these. You know
them, I suppose&mdash;Bessie and Sue and Bertha
Kitts&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Two alumnæ strolling between the houses and
the enclosure, chatting with friends and spying
out acquaintances.</i></p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> Good gracious, isn't she
through yet? I pity the poor girls, standing
all this while!</p>

<p><i>Second Alumna.</i> Yes, that's just it! Arrange
the oration to suit the girls, do!&mdash;If they're
tired, let them sit down! It's absurd to criticise
the one really academic exercise of the
whole affair entirely on the basis of the girls'
comfort, I say!</p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> But, my dear, the poor things
have done so much and stood so much anyhow&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
I should think Miss Maria would
be tired herself.</p>

<p><i>Second Alumna.</i> Then it's her own lookout.
She should have dropped one or the other.
They try to do too much. I can tell you that
we were proud enough to stand twenty minutes
when Ethel Richardson talked, and she
didn't feel that it was beneath her notice to
devote all her time and attention to that one
thing, either. We didn't make so much of
these universal geniuses then, but I doubt if
we had poorer results from the less widely
gifted. It's too much strain; one simply can't
do everything.</p>

<p><i>First Alumna.</i> No. They're 'way ahead of
us in lots of things, but I'm glad I came
when I did. Don't you remember what a good
time we used to have spring term? Dear old
last spring term! Do you know there isn't
any, now? Don't you remember how we
dropped ev&mdash;well, a good deal, and lay in
the hammocks in the orchard and mooned
about and took a long, comprehensive farewell
to all our greatness? We'd made or lost
our reputations by then, and we just took it
all in and&mdash;oh, I suppose we did sentimentalize
a little, but it all meant more to us apparently....
Well, it's all gone now. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
begin on the play so early, and it's all rehearsing,
and then they can't let their work
drop, so they keep everything right up to the
pitch&mdash;according to their story. And there are
six societies to our one, you know. And all
the houses give receptions to them right in a
bunch, and every one is so bored at them&mdash;at
least Kitty says they are. But you can't
always tell by that, I suppose.</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Applause from the enclosure and a general
scurry as the ushers crowd up to surround the
class, who begin their Ivy Song&mdash;a piece of musical
composition something between a Gregorian
chant and a Strauss waltz, with a great deal of
modulation, in which the words "hopes and fears,"
"coming years," "plant our vine," and "still entwine"
occur at suitable intervals. They wander
away in a bunch, frantically surrounded by the
ushers and the chain, to another side of College
Hall, where the Ivy is interred. A general break-up
then begins, the orator and the president join
their admiring families, and people begin to stroll
home, the prominent members of the class pausing
at every sentence to have their pictures taken.</i></p>

<p><i>Two members of the class and one of the Faculty.</i></p>

<p><i>First Member of Class.</i> It was the funniest
thing I've heard this year, really! You know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
the girls simply <i>slave</i> for her&mdash;they <i>slave</i>. They
can't help it, you know, for she thinks that's
all there is in the world and if you don't have
your note-book made out she looks at you in
such a way&mdash;oh, well, it makes Mollie's spine
cold, she says. Mollie's done splendid work
for her&mdash;not that she doesn't do it for everybody&mdash;but
she was determined to make her
see that she could be at all the rehearsals and
take the observations, too. The only thing
she didn't do was to go the last two or three
nights, but gracious, she'd more than made
that up! I thought I did pretty well when I
put in five hours of Lab., but those girls have
done eight and ten hours a week some weeks,
note-books and observations and all. Just to
satisfy her, you know&mdash;they love to work for
her. And what do you think she said the last
time they met? Do you know about Astronomy,
Mr. Brooke? If you do, I shall spoil the
story for you, for I don't know the first thing.
But I think it was the parallax of the sun.
"Now, I should think you could just step out
between the acts," said she, calmly, "if you
couldn't get out for all the evening, and take
your note-book with you, Miss Vanderveer,
and just take it&mdash;it's a beautiful observation!
And you've taken one, and it will be a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
thing to tell your children that you've gotten
the parallaxes of the sun yourself!"</p>

<p><i>Second Member of Class.</i> And when we
thought of Mollie dancing about there with
her collar undone, trying to make those idiotic
men understand something and being
everywhere at once&mdash;between the acts, you
know, being a fairly occupied time for her&mdash;when
we imagined her walking out of the garden
scene or Orsino's house to take the what-do-you-call-it
of the sun (though I don't see
how she could take it of the sun at night&mdash;it
must have been the moon, Ethel).</p>

<p><i>Member of Faculty.</i> And what did Miss
Vanderveer say?</p>

<p><i>First Member of Class.</i> I'm sure it was the
sun, Teddie, Mollie said sun&mdash;why, she
coughed and said, "I certainly will, if I get
time, Miss Drake!"</p>

<p><i>Member of Faculty.</i> Great presence of mind,
I'm sure.</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>Group of relatives and three members of the class.</i></p>

<p><i>First Member.</i> Mamma, this is Miss Twitchell
and Miss Fosdick&mdash;Maria and Malvolio,
you know.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> I am pleased to meet you both. I
want to tell you how much I enjoyed, <i>etc.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p><i>Misses Twitchell and Fosdick.</i> We're so glad
if you did, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> I was not able to catch much of
your speech, but Ellen tells me we can have
the pleasure of reading it later.</p>

<p><i>Miss Twitchell, moving away.</i> I'm afraid
you will have the opportunity&mdash;but I tried
to make it as short as I could!</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> And now I suppose you're going
home to sleep all day? I should think you'd
need it.</p>

<p><i>Miss Twitchell.</i> Oh, dear, no! I'm going to
the Alpha on the back campus this afternoon,
and I want to look in at Colloquium, and then
there's the Glee Club to-night, you know.
I've no more worry now, nothing to do but
enjoy myself.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> What is this, Ellen? The Glee Club&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> Why, Aunt Grace, the Glee Club
promenade, don't you know? That's when
the lanterns are all over, and they give a concert,
and we all walk about, and it's so pretty&mdash;don't
you remember I told you?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Well, then, I'll go right home and
take my nap, if I'm to go out to-night. Are
you going to all these things, too, Ellen?</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> Well, practically. Only I'm going to
Phi Kapp and Biological instead. But I <i>am</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
going to lie down&mdash;I'm so tired, I can't think
straight, and you know I'm on the Banjo
Club, and we have to have a short rehearsal&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">¶ <i>The crowd gradually disperses, and the campus
is practically deserted; men begin to put up poles
and wires for lanterns; others gather and arrange
scattered chairs. Stray relatives hunt for each
other and their boarding-places or inquire with
interest which is the Science Building and the
Dewey House. Belated members of the class wander
homewards or patiently seek out their families,
whose temporary guardians are thus relieved.</i></p>

<p><i>Abstracted member of the class and large, domineering
woman in black satin, before the Morris
House gate.</i></p>

<p><i>Large Woman.</i> This is the Hatfield, is it not?</p>

<p><i>Member of Class.</i> Oh! I beg your pardon?
No, it's the Morris.</p>

<p><i>Large Woman.</i> Ah! I was told it was the
Hatfield.</p>

<p><i>Member of Class, simply.</i> Well, it's not.</p>

<p><i>Large Woman.</i> And that over there (<i>pointing
to the Observatory</i>), that is the Lilly House?</p>

<p><i>Member of Class.</i> No, that's the Observatory.
Lilly Hall is up farther. It's just beyond
the Dickinson&mdash;no, the Lawrence&mdash;I
mean the <i>Hubbard House</i>!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p><i>Large Woman.</i> And where is the Hubbard
House?</p>

<p><i>Member of Class.</i> Oh, dear! (<i>pulls herself together
with an effort</i>) it's up in a line, the one,
two, three, third from here.</p>

<p><i>Large Woman.</i> Thank you. And I wish to
see the Botanical Gardens, too. Where are
they? (<i>Member of Class points out their position.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Large Woman.</i> And where is the Landscape
Garden?</p>

<p><i>Member of Class, vaguely.</i> Why, I suppose
it's over there, too. I don't exactly&mdash;it's all
landscape garden, I suppose&mdash;it's not big&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Large Woman, severely.</i> I was told there was
a fine landscape and botanical garden&mdash;are
you a member of the college?</p>

<p><i>Member of Class, leaning against the post.</i>
Why, yes, but it's all botanical garden, for
that matter. (<i>Catches sight of a tree with a tin
label tied to it and points luminously at it.</i>) <i>That's</i>
botanical, you know&mdash;all the trees and shrubs!</p>

<p><i>Large Woman, with irritation.</i> I am quite
aware that it is&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Member of Class, despairingly.</i> Oh, excuse
me, I mean it's&mdash;it's&mdash;<i>I mean they all have
labels!</i> (<i>Large Woman stalks majestically away;

<p class="stories">X<br />

THE END OF IT</p>

<p>There are two methods of conducting
a class supper. The first is
something like this: you pick out
three utterly unrelated girls who
never had anything to do with one another in
their lives, and call them the supper committee;
you pick out two clever, uninterested girls
and call them the toast committee; you pick
out an extremely busy girl who lives half a
mile off the campus and call her the seating
committee; you pick out a popular girl who is
supposed to be humorous because she laughs
at everybody's jokes and knows one comic
song, and call her the toast-mistress.</p>

<p>And this is the result of it: The supper
committee meets, wonders what under heaven
induced the president to appoint the other
two, finds out what caterer they had last year,
and after a little perfunctory argument employs
him again without further action, with
the result that one end of the table has five
kinds of ice cream and the other a horrifying
recurrence of lukewarm croquettes; the toast
committee spends a great deal of time in hunting
out extremely subtle quotations from
Shakespeare and Omar Khayyam, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
result that no one of the toasters gets the least
idea of how she is expected to elaborate her
theme; the seating committee is so harassed
by everybody that she gives up her diagram
in despair, and successive girls erase and sign
and re-erase till nobody but the three or four
leading sets in the class are satisfied, and they
are displeased because the toasters are either
put in a line at the head or scattered about the
tables, and that separates them from their immediate
cliques; the toast-mistress turns out
to be more appreciative than constructive, and
worries her friends and bores her enemies beyond
previous conception. The main body of
unimportant necessary people are crowded off
by themselves and feel somewhat flat and
heavy and irritated at the noisy groups beyond
them; the toasts are apt to be a little sad and
vague because the girls don't fit them and talk
too much about enduring friendships, the
larger life, four years of stimulating rivalry,
and alma mater. Why they do all this at this
season and this alone, only the Lord who
made them knows.</p>

<p>But Ninety-yellow did not employ this
method. It occurred to Theodora somewhat
originally, perhaps, as she looked around her
that last Tuesday evening, that a better class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
supper was never arranged. It can hardly be
asserted that it was a really good supper, for
it is to be doubted if a hundred and seventy-five
women ever sat down to a really good supper;
but there was almost enough of it, and it
was very nearly hot. Kathie Sewall had picked
the supper committee well, and they knew
one another thoroughly enough to give it all
to the chairman to do and to make fun of her
till she was spurred on to a really noble effort.
She knew that it is always damp and cold
class supper night, and planned accordingly.
Kitty Louisa Hofstetter managed the toasts,
and though Kitty Louisa was uneven and a
little vulgar at times, she was clever in her
unexpected hail-fellow-well-met way and popular
with the class for the most part. She had
a genius for puns of the kind that grow better
as they grow worse, and they were shamelessly
italicized in the toast-cards, which caused great
merriment before the toasts had begun. And
the seating was very well done, for the class
was nicely broken up and mixed about among
the tables till everybody was within four or
five of a reasonably important person.</p>

<p>As for the toast-mistress&mdash;well, you see,
Theodora's opinion of her might have been
a trifle exaggerated, for she was Theodora's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
best friend. How little she had changed, Theo
thought, as she watched her rumple her hair
in the same funny, boyish way that she had
freshman year. Theo had seen her first in the
main hall, floating with the current of freshmen
that pushed its way almost four hundred
strong to meet its class officer and find out
that O. G. meant Old Gymnasium. That far-off
freshman year! Theo smelt again the clean,
washed floor; saw again the worried shepherds
herding their flocks into the scheduled stalls
and praying that the parents might go soon
and leave their darlings, if misunderstood, at
least unencumbered; heard again the buzz and
hum of a thousand chattering, scuffling girls,
bubbling over with a hundred greetings for
each other.</p>

<p>"Hello, Peggy! Peggy! I say, <i>hello
Peggy</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hello! Have a good time?"</p>

<p>"Grand! Did you?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly fine&mdash;I saw Ursula and Dodo
and&mdash;Oh, Ursula! hello! Here I am!"</p>

<p>"Why, Peggy Putney, you dear old thing!
When did you come? They say you're in
the Hatfield&mdash;how did you get there?"</p>

<p>"Two ahead of me and they dropped out.
Miss Roberts only just told me&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>Theodora had felt very lonesome and homesick
just then&mdash;everybody but herself knew
so many people! And then Virginia had happened
along and jostled her and begged pardon,
and they had fallen into a conversation
on the relative merits of the Dewey and the
Hatfield. Later they had studied Livy together
and confided their difficulties to each
other. Virginia's mother was a Unitarian and
her father was an Ethical Culturist, and her
room-mate was a High Church Episcopalian
and never ate meat in Lent! She thought Virginia
would very probably be damned, if not
in the next life, certainly in this, and she intimated
as much. Virginia thought it was very
hard to live with somebody who disapproved of
you so much.</p>

<p>Theodora had been brought up to be a neat,
self-helpful little person, and her room-mate,
Edith Bliss, had never even seen her bed made
up and left her clothes in piles on the floor just
as she stepped out of them. She was horribly
homesick and wept quarts every Sunday afternoon,
and confided to Theodora in moments
of hysterical relaxation that she thought
every girl owed it to herself to have soup and
black coffee for dinner and that she was going
to wire Papa to take her home immediately.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Theo looked at her now, eagerly devouring
a doubtful lobster concoction and openly
congratulating herself on the olives at her left.
She was fond of Frankfurters now, was Edith,
and had recently alarmed the authorities by
her ingenuous scheme for annexing a night-lunch
cart and keeping it on the campus: it
would have been so nice, she said regretfully,
to slip out and get a Frankfurter between
hours!</p>

<p>How pretty the Gym looked! The juniors
had decorated it as well as they could at odd
minutes, and they had lingered in a bunch as
the class came in to lean over the balcony and
sing to them.</p>

<p>Theodora remembered how the Gym had
looked the night of the sophomore reception:
all light and music and girls and a wonder of
excitement. She had never had an evening
dress before, and her little square-necked organdie
had been dearer to her than any other
gown before or since. They played <i>Rastus on
Parade</i>, and she had such nice partners and
some of the girls were so lovely and had such
white, beautiful shoulders&mdash;they seemed to
count evening dress but a slight and ordinary
thing. By junior year house-dances are wont
to pall, and seniors have been known to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
rabbits and read Kipling in preference; even
among the freshmen Theodora had found
some disillusioned souls who lamented the
absence of men and found the sophomore
reception slow!</p>

<p>Across the table an odd, distinguished-looking
girl, with a clever face and dark, short-sighted
eyes, smiled at her, and Theo's thoughts
flashed back to that great day when she first
really loved the class&mdash;the day of the Big
Game. What a funny, snub-nosed little nobody
Marietta Hinks had been then! But
how she played! How she dodged and doubled
and bounced the ball, and how they
cheered her!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> to Mari<i>etta</i>,</p>
<p>For we <i>shall</i> not soon <i>forget</i> her&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, well, how they had grown up! Now
she was "Miss Root" to the little, dark-eyed
girl in the back seat in chapel, who smiled so
shyly at her when the seniors led out down
the middle aisle. Theo was wearing her roses
to-night, and as she scratched off a little note
to thank her she had seemed to see herself,
another little dark-eyed girl, sending anonymous
roses to Ursula Wyckoff. Dear me!
would anybody ever again combine such
graces of mind and body as that ornament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
of Ninety-purple? She had gone on wheel-rides
with Theo, and once she had asked her
over to wait on the juniors at a spread&mdash;Theo
had sat up and got her light reported
in order to write home about it.</p>

<p>There are those, I understand, who disapprove
strongly of this attitude of Theodora's
happy year: dogmatic young women who have
not learned much about life and soured, middle-aged
women who have forgotten. I am
told that they would consider Theodora's
adoration morbid and use long words about
her&mdash;long words about a freshman! I have
always been sorry for these unfortunate people:
their chances for reconstructing Human
Nature seem to me so relatively slight.</p>

<p>When Theo had gone home that summer
with hands almost as well cared for as Ursula's,
sleek, gathered-in locks, and a gratifying hold
on the irregular verbs (Ursula spoke beautiful
French), her mother had whimsically inquired
if Miss Wyckoff could not be induced to remain
in Northampton indefinitely and continue
her unscheduled courses! But perhaps
she was a morbid mother.</p>

<p>Her mother! The plates and flowers swam
before Theodora's misted eyes, and the sight
of Virginia&mdash;so kind that year&mdash;brought back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
somehow those waves of desolation that would
come over her again and again, in lecture
rooms, in her own dear room, at meals&mdash;all
that clouded sophomore year. It was just as
her good fortune came through the mail to
her&mdash;a room in the Nicest House&mdash;that her
mother died, and rooms mattered little to
Theo, then. There were kindly aunts and
other children, and she was not needed at
home; so it seemed best to go on, and she
had come up the steps of the Nicest House,
a little black-dressed figure, and into the arms
of the Nicest Woman.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that there was never a
room so cheerful, nor pictures so lovely, nor
a fire so red, nor tea and bread and butter so
good, nor a smile so comfortable as the Nicest
Woman's. Mademoiselle and Fräulein and
Miss Roberts were sweet and kind, and the
girls did all they could, but it was to the Nicest
Woman that one came when conditions and
warnings were in the air or one's head ached
or one had eaten too much fudge or been annoyed
by somebody's banjo practice. When
the seniors of the Nicest House were eating
and laughing there at night, it was a gay room&mdash;the
Nicest Woman's; but it was very dim
and quiet in the dusk, when Theodora slipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
in by herself with reddened lids, and sat on the
couch, and they talked of things that started
to be sad but somehow always turned out
cheerful; for when it was about the children
and Will at Yale little jokes were sure to
come up, and when Theo wondered if perhaps
she hadn't been careless about writing home,
and if Mother had gotten more letters in
the spring, maybe&mdash;the conversation always
changed, and she found herself feeling so glad
and thankful that she'd gone right home in
June and not visited at Virginia's.</p>

<p>Virginia had gone into Phi Kappa that winter,
and Theo had been so proud of her. She
was in the first five, and as she really hadn't
expected it at all it was quite exciting. Adelaide
Carew went in too, and though she went
about with the seniors a great deal and called
most of her class "Miss," she was much more
generally liked than in her freshman year, and
Virginia had got to know her better and better.
Through her Theo had seen more of Adelaide,
and she had been amazed to find out
how really kind-hearted and human she was
beneath her unapproachable ways.</p>

<p>But then, you never could tell&mdash;girls were
so queer! Only last night, when they were
walking about under the lanterns after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
concert, she and Virginia and Adelaide, with
two of the junior ushers, and the juniors, sophisticated
young people, had cynically suggested
that perhaps they'd better take themselves
away in order that the three might seek
out their Ivy and bedew it with their final tears,
Adelaide had coughed a little huskily and suggested
that perhaps when they'd planted their
own Ivy they wouldn't be feeling so gay!
They had stared at her blankly, hesitated,
decided that coming from such a source it
must have been an extraordinarily acute sarcasm,
and gone away giggling, leaving Theo
to wonder and Adelaide to flush and talk very
hard about Bar Harbor and the comfort of a
big room all to yourself once more.</p>

<p>Such a strange room-mate as Theo had had
that year&mdash;she seemed fated to room with
girls who had never made up their beds. This
one had lived freshman year with friends in the
town, and had had everything done for her,
and when Theo asked her one day if campus
life was wearing on her, she had turned two
stormy gray eyes on her and burst out, "Oh,
no, Theodora, but I am so <i>deadly</i> tired of
picking up my night-gown every <i>single</i> morning,
I think I shall <i>die</i>!"</p>

<p>On one historic occasion, early in the year,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Theo had happened to make up her bed for
her, and upon her pleased recognition of the
fresh linen it had come out that she had been
for some weeks accustomed to change her upper
sheet and leave the under one undisturbed
on the bed&mdash;it had seemed more logical, she
said, and how was she to know? They had
teased her about it till the Nicest Woman interfered
and fined every girl who mentioned
it, and they bought <i>Sentimental Tommy</i> with
the money, and read it evenings in the Nicest
Woman's room after supper.</p>

<p>Well, well, they'd sit about her fire no
more, as the poem said that somebody wrote
to go with the silver tea-ball the seniors gave
her when she served them their last tea.
They'd come in no more after Alpha and
Phi Kapp to tell her all about it&mdash;how nice
she had been when Theo got into Alpha!
That was junior year and they took her to
Boyden's for supper, and her bowl and
pitcher were full of violets for days. Everybody
seemed so glad, and Martha Sutton had
pinned her own pin on Theo's red blouse.
Kathie Sewall had taken her over&mdash;nobody
dreamed that Kathie would be senior president
then&mdash;and what a hand-shaking there
had been! And such a funny, clever play, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
butlers and burglars and lady's-maids&mdash;it was
illustrative of American literature, she learned
later, but it was not a pedantic illustration.</p>

<p>Theodora loved plays, and she had delighted
in her very humble part in the House play. She
was a little house-maid, and said only, "Yes,
madam," and "No, madam," and, "Oh, sir,
how can you&mdash;a poor girl like me!" but she
had a great American Beauty and two bunches
of violets, and she sent the programme home.
Next to its basket-ball decorations she remembered
the Gym arranged for a play, with the
running-track turned into boxes and the girls
prettier than ever against the screens and pillows.
She had been chairman of the stage-setting
committee, and the <i>Monthly</i> had especially
commended the boudoir scene.</p>

<p>Were they ready for the toasts so soon?
Where had the time gone? she thought, as
Virginia, with solemn pomp, called upon Miss
Farwell to respond to "Our Team." Dear old
Grace&mdash;she stammered a little when she was
excited, and she was not the most fluent of
speakers, but they cheered her to the echo.
"Team! Team! Team!" they called, and the
teams, freshman and sophomore, Regulars and
Subs, had to stand on their chairs and be sung
to. As Theo balanced on a tottering seat, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
caught sight of a crowd of girls moving toward
the Gym, and as they sat down a shout
from below greeted them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Oh, <i>here's</i> to Ninety-<i>yellow</i>,</p>
<p class="i4">And her <i>praise</i> we'll ever <i>tell</i>&mdash;<i>oh</i>,</p>
<p>Drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, drink her <i>down</i>, down, <i>down</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A cheerful, aimless creature at the bottom
of one of the great tables, whose one faculty
was for improvised doggerel, instructed her
neighbors rapidly, and they sent back a tuneful
courtesy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> the Junior <i>Ushers</i>,</p>
<p>And I <i>tell</i> you they are <i>rushers</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Theodora had "ushed," in classical phrase,
in her day, and the bustle of last year, so much
more exciting somehow than this one, came
back to her. Her little, white-ribboned stick
was packed now&mdash;in fact, everything was
packed: she was going away for good! Some
one else would lounge on the window-seat in
her room in the Nicest House, and light the
cunning fire....</p>

<p>Who was this? Oh, this was Sallie Wilkes
Emory, responding to "The Faculty." Kitty
Louisa, whose soul knew not reverence, had
attached to this toast the pregnant motto,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
<i>That we may go forward with Faculties unimpaired</i>,
an excerpt from one of the President's
best-known chapel prayers, and Sallie was developing
the theme in what she assured them
was a very connotative manner. Theo saw
them pass in review before her, those devoted
educators, from her dazed freshman Livy to
her despairing senior Philosophy&mdash;<i>that</i> was
over, at least! Theodora was not of a technically
philosophical temperament. Sallie was
quoting liberally from a recent famous essay
of her own: <i>The Moral Law, or the End-Aim
of Human Action According to Kant</i>, apropos
of which she had remarked to the commendatory
professor that she was glad if <i>somebody</i>
understood it! Sallie was a great girl&mdash;how
grand she had been in the play! Theo had
been in the mob herself, having first tried
for every part, and had enjoyed every minute
of it, from the first rehearsal to the last dab
of make-up. She had been an attendant and
hadn't an idea how pretty she looked, nor
how many people spoke of her and called
her graceful.</p>

<p>It may have been because Theo had so few
ideas about herself that she had so many
friends. And how many she had! She took
great pride in them, those fine, strong, good-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
girls that hailed her from all directions,
and always wanted a dance or a row or
a skating afternoon with her. She wondered
if anybody so ordinary&mdash;for Theo knew she
wasn't clever&mdash;ever had so many jolly good
friends. There was the Mandolin Club, now&mdash;all
friends of hers. She got on late in junior
year and played in the spring concert. Her
father came up and said he'd never seen such
a pretty house in his life&mdash;packed from orchestra
circle to balcony with fluffy girls alternated
with dapper, black-coated youths. He
gave Theo such a darling white gown for it, all
ruffled with white ribbon, and she had her picture
taken in it, holding the mandolin, and sent
it to him in a big white vellum frame covered
with yellow chrysanthemums, with "Smith"
scrawled in yellow across one corner. He kept
it on his desk and was tremendously proud
when his friends asked about it.</p>

<p>Here were the class histories. Theodora
thought she listened, but though she laughed
with the rest and applauded the grinds, it was
her own history that she was reading as face after
face recalled to her some joke or mistake or
good luck. Not that it was sad&mdash;oh, dear, no!
If any member of the class of Ninety-yellow
dared to be sad that night there was a fine, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
more than that, the studied coldness of the
class directed toward her: it was an orgy, not an
obsequy, as Virginia elegantly put it. Just as
the junior history, which is always the best for
some unexplained reason&mdash;perhaps because
of the Prom&mdash;was finished, there was a loud
knock, and a big bunch of yellow roses from the
class that was having a decennial supper somewhere
was brought in by a useful sophomore.
They clapped it and sent some one back to
thank them&mdash;a point of etiquette that some
self-centred classes have been known to omit&mdash;and
then they remembered that Ninety-green
was supping at its first reunion in the
Old Gym, and sent over some of the table
flowers to them. Virginia motioned to Theo,
and proud of the mission and blushing a little
at the eyes that turned to her as she went, she
took them over. They clapped and sang to
her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> to <i>Theodora</i>,</p>
<p>And we're <i>very</i> glad we <i>sor</i> her!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Martha Sutton waved to her and the toast-mistress
thanked her for the class, and she
went back&mdash;alone, because, being an older
class, Ninety-green didn't need a delegate.
On the way, two juniors met her, and they
condoled with her cheerfully: "How do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
feel, Theo dear? Isn't it kind of dreadful?
Do you keep thinking it's the last time?
Goodness&mdash;I should!" One of them threw
a sympathetic arm over her shoulder and
looked at the moon, but Theo grinned a little
and said that she was tired as a dog and
that if there was one place in the world she
wanted it was her room At Home. And as
the juniors gaped at this matter-of-fact attitude,
Theodora added, pausing at the Gym
door, "Of course I've had a perfectly grand
time here, and all that, but I've been here
four years and that's about long enough, you
know. And they want me, of course, and&mdash;I
want to come! I think it gets a little&mdash;well,
toward the end, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Theo was tired, and so are seniors all,
and until three or four generations of them
have learned how to do it easily, so will they be.</p>

<p>They were doing stunts upstairs: Clara
Sheldon had seen Cissie Loftus who had seen
Maggie Cline who sang <i>Just tell them that you
saw me</i>, and Clara, who was the most tailor-made
and conventional creature imaginable to
the outward eye, was forced by those from
whose farther-reaching scrutiny she was never
free, to imitate the imitator at all social functions
that admitted song. She used stiff, absurd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
gestures and a breathy contralto that
never palled upon her friends. Cynthia Lovering
danced her graceful little Spanish dance
for them, and Leslie Guerineau told them her
best darkey story in her own delicious Southern
drawl. And then there was a murmur that
grew to a voice that swelled into a shout as
they drummed on the table and called, "<i>We</i>
want <i>Dutton</i>! <i>We</i> want <i>Dutton</i>! <i>We</i> want <i>Dutton</i>,
<i>Dutton</i>, <i>Dutton</i>!"</p>

<p>She said no; that she'd had a toast; that
they knew all her stunts by heart&mdash;but they
hammered on her name with the regularity of
a machine till she got up at last with a sigh
and, "Well, what do you want?" They wanted
a temperance lecture, and she drooped her head
to one side, and with an ineffably sickly smile
and a flat nasal drawl she told them "haow
she'd been a-driving 'raound your <i>graounds</i>,
and they're <i>reel</i> pleasantly situated, <i>too</i>, dears,
and your <i>President</i>, such a nice, <i>gentlemanly</i> man,
accompanied me, and pointed aout to me your
<i>beeyutiful</i> homes and I said to him, 'Oh, what
a <i>beeyutiful</i> thought it is that all these <i>hundreds</i>
of young souls are a-drinking <i>water</i>, nothing
but <i>water</i>, all the time and every day!'"</p>

<p>She was going to teach in a stuffy little
school in the wilds of Maine, and Ethel Eaton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
who had been taught in that school, was going
to travel abroad for a year&mdash;it was a strange
shuffle.</p>

<p>What, was it half-past eleven? Impossible!
But somebody had started up their great song
that had been their pet one since freshman
year, and they were shouting it till the Gym
rang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hurrah!</i> <i>hurrah!</i> the <i>yellow</i> is on <i>top</i>,</p>
<p><i>Hurrah!</i> <i>hurrah!</i> the <i>purple</i> cannot <i>drop</i>;</p>
<p><i>We</i> are Ninety-<i>yellow</i> and our <i>fame</i> shall never <i>stop</i>,</p>
<p class="i2"><i>'Rah</i>, 'rah, <i>'rah</i>, for the <i>seniors!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They sang all the verses, and then the
watchman and the superintendent of buildings,
waiting like sleuth-hounds to prevent
any demonstration from without, gritted their
teeth and dashed furiously down the wrong
stairs as Ninety-green, who had softly assembled
at the back of the Gym, having come
from different directions, burst into the traditional
tribute:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> to Ninety-<i>yellow</i>,</p>
<p>And her <i>fame</i> we'll ever <i>tell</i>&mdash;<i>oh</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"'Ere, 'ere! stop that now! Miss Sutton,
it ain't allowed&mdash;will you please to go 'ome
quietly! No, they ain't a-comin' h'out till you
go&mdash;'e says they ain't!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, come now! We aren't students any
more! We can do what we like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, girls! Don't make a fuss;
we don't want to stay, anyhow!"</p>

<p>They sang themselves away, and the class
upstairs looked around the tables and thought
things, for it was time to go. And here I am
afraid I shall lose whatever friends I may have
gained for Theodora, for it is necessary to
state that none of those comprehensive, solemn
moments of farewell, known to us all to
be the property of departing seniors, came to
her. She was conscious of a little vague excitement,
but all the last days had been more
or less exciting&mdash;generally less&mdash;and her
mind was occupied with irrelevant details.
Had Uncle Ed remembered to change at
Hartford? Had Aunt Kate packed her black
evening dress? Would the post-office forward
that note to the little freshman? Could she
get Virginia up in time for the 9.15? Had
she lost the slip with the Nicest Woman's
address on it? And had she given Marietta
that senior picture yet?</p>

<p>There had been one moment when her
throat had contracted and her eyelids had
crinkled: it was that very evening, when Annie,
the cook, had beckoned to her in the hall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
of the Nicest House, and said: "There's
three o' them little cakes on a plate on your
table, Miss The'dora. I shan't be bakin' 'em
agin, an' I know you do be terrible fond of
'em!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Annie," she had said, and
shaken her hand warmly. Annie had cooked
fifteen years in the Nicest House, and what
she and her mistress didn't know about girls
you could put in a salt-spoon. It wasn't every
girl that Annie liked, either.</p>

<p>Grace was getting up, and they stood a
moment irresolutely by the chairs.</p>

<p>"Let's make a ring, girls, and sing once
'round, and say good-by till next year," she
said; and then there was a little quick shuffling,
and the carefully divided sets got together
and stood as they had stood for the
last two or three years. Theo took tight hold
of Virginia and Adelaide, and they moved
slowly around the tables, a great circle of girls,
so quiet for a moment that Ninety-green,
singing one another home around the campus,
sounded as loud and clear as their own voices
a moment ago. They listened with a common
impulse as the rollicking <i>Tommy Atkins</i> song
paused awhile under the Washburn windows;
they had been very fond of Ninety-green.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ninety-<i>green</i> she is a <i>winner</i>,</p>
<p>Ninety-<i>green</i> she is a <i>star</i>,</p>
<p>Is there <i>any</i>thing <i>agin</i> her?</p>
<p>No, we <i>do</i> not think there <i>are</i>!</p>
<p>There have <i>been</i> some other <i>classes</i>,</p>
<p>Other <i>seniors</i> have been <i>seen</i>,</p>
<p>But they <i>cannot</i> match the <i>lasses</i></p>
<p>That are <i>wearing</i> of the <i>green</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They smiled a little and remembered the
great mass of green flags and ribbons that had
waved to that song in last year's Rally. But
they did not answer with one of their own; a
little of the first faint conviction that the college
owns all her classes, the feeling that grows with
the years, came to them, and as the circle pressed
closer and closer and their steps fell into an even
tramp, Grace called out, "Now, girls, here's to
old Smith College!" and they sent it out over
the campus, so strong and loud that the decennial
people and the groups of Ninety-green
and the juniors and the belated sophomores
lurking about heard them and joined in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, <i>here's</i> to old Smith <i>College</i>, drink her <i>down</i>!</p>

<p class="center">12<i>mo</i>, $1.50</p>

<p>An animated picture of a particularly active-minded
and picturesque community is contained in Miss
Daskam's volume. "Smith" may be taken as an epitome
of the woman's college world; and these ten stories have
a real value accordingly in showing what the undergraduate
life of many thousands of American young women
really is in its varied phases, illustrating their ambitions,
manners, occupations, and traits.</p>

<p>The stories, however, show that a good deal of human
nature exists within college walls, and they will certainly
appeal as strongly to the fiction-lover as to the sociologist,
being written with great cleverness and sparkle, and
clearly the work of a born writer of stories.</p>

<p>The new story of college life by the author of "Princeton

and has already been pronounced (by the New York
<i>Evening Sun</i>) "a better picture of college life than the
same author's 'Princeton Stories'" (which is now in its

blended, escapades and adventures&mdash;all tending to the
building up of a typical American character, brim the
book with genuine life."</p>
